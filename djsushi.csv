2,Hye Ryung J.,"Don't go to this restaurant. The asian waitress there is totally rude and ignorant to customers. I saw one customer next to me who ordered takeout and he was asking her if the food is already done. The waitress's voice is really low that nobody can HELL understand. The customer obviously didn't hear what she was saying and suddenly she looks at him with a poor reaction and answered him annoyingly. She doesn't attend other customers properly as well. I mean with that behavior she should be fired, in my opinion.

Moreover the price is quite expensive compared to it's taste. The food that I ordered wasn't that bad, but still isn't worth it.

Anyway the service was really horrible that I didn't even give them a tip.

3,Kailyn T.,"This review will be quick and snappy. 

We came to DJ Sushi trying to decide between a higher rated place further away, or to go with the closer, three star place that was DJ. It shows that sometimes it pays to try 'em out for yourself. 

Definitely a-okay, and gets extra points because that roll with the mango in it was a sweet surprise that I find rarer to find and for the top notch service even as we came in towards the closing hours of the night. 

If you are already in the neighborhood, it's a good pick and does the trick.

6,Quincy H.,"I LOVE THEIR FOOD!! I came in specifically for the hot sake ( wanted to try some while I was in the area) when I came in I was seated immediately right next to the big TV.  I ordered the sake first and explained I'll be ""checking in"" for the free edamame. After they came out she explained I should order more because if I don't they'll charge me for the edamame. I felt pressured so I ordered the hamachi Shashimi. It was good. Over all decent meal. Wasn't particularly impressed but I'm feeling full. While drinking she was nice enough to make sure I was drinking water. Excellent

8,George B.,"I really had a good time with a bunch of friends coming here. The food was good, the servers were nice and the beer was cold. The parking is hard but what do you except in Sf. I also was surprised why people was rating it 1 or 2 stars. I guess a lot of people that come out to dine want the world handed to them for 35 bucks. Also even if you breath wrong people will put one star. My point is that you have to try places out your self and not rely on yelp users. If you don't have the $ better not go out to dine and rating low because you think it is expensive. I had a great time and will come again.

9,Reginice C.,"We ordered a teriyaki salmon bento box, Sunomono Cucumber, and Lion King Roll from DJ Sushi.

My friend said the Lion King Roll was really good, so that's why this is a 2-Star rating instead of 1-Star. She said her Sunomono was really bad and tasted weird.

The piece of salmon in my bento box was slightly bigger than the soy sauce packet see photo for reference.

We are currently sitting in the hotel hungry and planning to go out to get food.

10,Steff D.,"I was craving sushi after an extremely long flight from the East Coast, but due to delays I didn't get into SF until close to 11p. There weren't that many places open for delivery so late, so I was delighted that DJ Sushi could accommodate me!

Unfortunately, I wasn't excited by what I got: the edamame was a bit hard and had no salt. The wakame salad was a bit slimy. The miso soup was cold. The hand rolls (I got the cucumber, avocado, and avocado with cream cheese) were just three bites of mostly rice. 

I don't know if this was because it was one of their last orders of the night or if this is how it normally is, but I can't say I'd order from here again (though, again, I'm super duper appreciative that they could take care of my post travel late night dinner needs!).

18,Hayley D.,"Met my boyfriend here for lunch since it's about half way between our offices. He had been before and said it was pretty good ramen.

Ambiance: I am guessing they call it DJ because they were playing EDM style music the whole time- kind of cool. The inside is pretty small, only about 6 tables or so.

Service: Really great service here. Our server was really nice and helped me find a vegetarian ramen to have. She checked in on us a lot and was quick to bring us what we needed.

Food: I got the tempura ramen with vegetarian broth. It was just OK. The noodles were all stuck together in one big clump, and the flavor was pretty bland but it wasn't horrible. My boyfriend got the ramen with meat in it and also said his was very bland. I loved the mushrooms in mine! I've never seen that type of mushroom before.

Would be willing to try the sushi here, but I like other ramen spots downtown more.

The service is always fast and friendly.

0,Emily S.,"I ordered through eat24 and my order was suppose to be delivered to me by 8:30... My order did not come until 9:10 and I ordered my dinner at 7:45... I even called the restaurant at 8:45 and the lady said oh we just sent the delivery guy out he should be there in 10 min which became 20min later... My order consisted of 2 bowls of ramen, one for me and one for a friend, 2 order of sushi rolls and seaweed salad. Seaweed salad was ok, but the rolls... $4 for one roll each and it was those hand rolls I one seaweed... Not a long one cut into pieces... They weren't that big either... What a rip off... Next up, the ramen... Ok ramen is better fresh and not delivered ok, but the soup didn't even have flavor and I asked for spicy on both and it wasn't even spicy. The noddles tasted like instant noodles and the texture felt like that too. It was all clumped up together even when I poured my soup in it... Bad delivery and estimated time and no flavor in the soup and what a rip off on the sushi

24,Kristina M.,"My friend and I decided to eat sushi for dinner. I ordered the Bento Box ($12) with an Avocado/Cucumber Roll (6 pieces) and Veggie Tempura (5 pieces). I also checked in and got free edamame. Edamame was originally $4.50. My friend ordered the Sushi Combo F ($16.50).

I thought the edamame was really good. The size was pretty decent even though we got it for free by checking into Yelp. Even if it was $4.50, it would have been a really good deal. It was warm and soft enough to bite into it. The miso soup that came with my order was warm as well. My bento box was good and large. The tempura was very crunchy and consisted of yam (3 pieces), broccoli, and a carrot piece. 

My friend was able to ask for extra wasabi for free. 

The waiter checked in with us and asked if our food was good. 

I will say that both of our meals were a little bit on the expensive side. 

The place can be a little loud. We sat next to a TV and it was showing something violent that was on TNT. There was one man who was pulling another man's intestines out and he was screaming. It was very gross and I tried not to look at the screen. Other than that, the overall experience was good.

Note: There is a minimum $10 credit card charge and you can only use a maximum of 2 credit cards per table.

25,Taylor D.,"This place has become one of our favorite sushi spits. It's cheap, it's fast, it's conveniently located, and the food is pretty damn good. 

The inside is nothing fancy. They only have 5 tables in the whole restaurant. But, the fast and friendly service makes up for the cramped vibe you may get while dining here.

My go-to is the curashi Dan sashimi combo, 17$. It is 12-15 slices of sashimi (depending on what fresh fish the chef's have available, and how thick the chef slices the fish), atop a bed of sushi rice with a side if seaweed salad and a cup of miso soup! My boyfriend and I have had several of the rolls on their menu, all if which have been pretty good. Their hand rolls (Maki) are an amazing value - usually 5-7$ and it's just as much fish as the regular rolls, just a little harder to eat. 

The sake menu here is pretty great too - most of their sake bottles are between 10-15$ and you'll get 12-16 shots out of it! Their happy hour is okay - nothing special... But their wine is a little cheaper and there are a few appetizers included. 

We will continue to eat here when we are craving sushi in North beach!

I got the chashu ramen and my boyfriend got the tonkatsu ramen (both $10), which were both tasty and filling. I particularly thought the chashu was really well cooked and yummy. We also got the 49er roll ($11.50), which was on the small side but still delicious.

38,Jon L.,"The former Mura although nothing has changed about the space apart from the name. Decent enough ramen but odd service and business decisions distract. 

I like the pork belly ramen. Perhaps a tad salty but I enjoy it nonetheless. Pretty generous toppings for a $10 bowl and the noodles have a decent bite to them. My issue here is that they leave the front door open which on a really cold SF night, makes the ramen lukewarm-tepid the moment it arrives at the table. I guess they keep the door open to let folks know they are open but it takes away from the ramen. You really want the bowl of noodles to arrive pipping hot. The one server was doing her best but obviously overwhelmed. 

More of a place for subsistence eating, pop by if you're looking for a cheap ramen fix but definitely not a destination spot by any means.

Only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the fact that we were the only two people eating inside the restaurant and service was ridiculously slow they had only one girl manning tables and to-go orders and they were slammed with to-go orders it seemed like she was more concerned with those than being attentive with us but we got our food pretty quickly and it was good so I might comeback if we're ever here again.

Well, this place is a good bet. Your not going to have to go into confession by entering this establishment. This is a top notch Sushi bar. Once you walk in you will know it isn't the cookie cutter chain you are so tired of going to. 

Outside the signage is hidden as if it were a speakeasy. Then once you enter there is an entry hall that creates a private, comfortable setting. As you enter more inside you get to a raised dining area on your left. Its all very cozy. Very comfortable. Kitchen to the right sort of covered up with workers exiting and entering frequently. To the rear more seating.

Food came at a timely manner. Good presentation, cooked nicely. Flavors were there but it didn't make me crave more. If I had to pick my favorite, it would probably be the Lion King Roll. Everything is decent. One thing that bugged me was having to ask 2 different waitresses for a fork. We told them and they said OK, but never came back with a fork. Happened several times. Halfway through our meal, she finally came back. They were nice and apologetic but would have been nice to not wait that long.

That being said, I was disappointed by the entire trinity: broth, noodles and meat.  Since there are a bunch of ramen options downtown, there really is no good reason for sub-par ramen.

Gyoza: Completely deep fried.  I definitely prefer the pan-fried (i.e. potsticker) style since I like the contrast of boiled and fried on the same dumpling.  It wasn't that memorable.

Chashu Ramen: A pork bone broth, but no where near as rich as a traditional tonkotsu.  The noodles were a bit disappointing, a little too al dente; tasted like something from a package you'd get at the supermarket.  The pork belly was cold (despite resting in warm soup) and was pretty dry (despite resting in wet soup).  The half egg was cooked decently though.

48,Briana Z.,"My heart extends out to mom and pop establishments where the people who own the restaurant are the ones cooking in the kitchen, busting the tables, and taking the orders. This is one of those establishments. 

The veggie tempura ramen I had was absolutely delectable--reminds me almost of the famous Ippudo in NYC. All the ramens have the option of spicy or not spicy, which is right up my alleyway since the spicier the better.  My mom typically prefers udon, but since this place only offers ramen noodles, she opted for that instead. She was definitely not disappointed as she was raving about about the grilled chicken ramen the entire time! 

We were both very dehydrated after the meal though. The MSG level was probably off the charts, but treat yoself to a savory delight every once in a while. A little monosodium glutamate never killed nobody, (I hope.) 

Tip: If you're using the groupon, the combos aren't valid with it. (There is a combo option where if you order a ramen ($10-$11 per bowl), you can order gyoza, or California rolls, or any other small dish for $3.95.)

I ended up getting the Mix Party Tray, which included a variety of their classic and specialty rolls as well as an assortment of nigiri. When the delivery came, we looked inside and the platters were arranged in a delightful display. All the rolls looked delicious and the fish on the nigiri was really fresh.

Other than being a little late to deliver for a team shindig, the spring rolls, chicken gyoza, and edamame were tasty and in plentiful supply. Delivery person was friendly and fast.

Very poor value relative to other sushi/ramen places in SF. Rolls are tiny. Extreme skimping on ramen toppings - I got 3.5 sad slices of pork belly and half an egg. The noodles tasted no better than Maruchan instant.

Inside, it's quite cozy with a tv in the middle of the room. Good for watching a game with a small group of friends. The sushi roll and ramen were both pretty standard, with the ramen leaning towards being a little salty.

First the water tasted like soap.  Then we checked in on yelp to get the free edamame (miso soup or soda was the other options) which we never got. Ramen noodles were tough (different from al dente).  Sushi were on the small side especially for $17.50.  I'm glad I didn't get omakase, I would have been much more disappointed.  Rice on the sushi was not consistent and no good.  I bit into some hard rice kernels that may have been from the bottom of the pot, not sure.  All I know for sure is I'm never coming back.

I ordered 2 sushi rolls on both occasions, so 16 pieces of sushi, and I requested 2 sides of unagi sauce because I know that the container that they put the sauce in is really tiny, and they give me about 2 drops of sauce in ONE container for 16 pieces of sushi which was only enough sauce for ONE piece of sushi, so I spent $40 on dry sushi on both occasions because they are too cheap to give me what I asked for. 
Is pre-made unagi sauce that expensive that I can't get any? You wouldn't eat a dry hot dog without ketchup, would you? 
There are hundreds of sushi restaurants in San Francisco. I'll go to the proper ones that are run by people with brains. Such a shame that a business loses repeat local customers over 3 cents. It was a delivery order both times, so I couldn't request additional sauce.

64,Lei H.,"We have been here three times and tonight was the worse and we won't be back.  The combination of inconsistent quality food and mediocre service are the reasons. 

We had 
- the chashu ramen and that's ok. My older daughter liked this 
- the fried chicken ramen and the chicken tasted a bit sour.  I think it's just old.  We are now worried about food poisoning.   We told the waiter to tell the chef.  We didn't expect a refund just a comment as we ate the ramen and left most of the chicken.  He didn't know what to say. 
- dragon roll.  This was pretty good
- Walu nigiri.  Fairly skim on the fish
- hamachi Kama.  First time we had this was great.  This time it was undercooked and we had to ask them to go back and cook it more.  He did apologize but by this time we have lost our good impression of this place

To add on to this, service is lacking.  I had to ask for plates, bowls.  It's a Chinese run Japanese place and the waiter didn't speak much English.  I started to speak to him in mandarin. That helped a little. 

Lastly, we were using a restaurant.com coupon.  We felt a little bit like a second class citizen as soon as he heard this.  

Imagine our whole family felt pretty unsatisfied with the meal and we paid $25 less than full price.  How disappointing.  Was hoping to be a regular here as its 5 blocks from our house.  No more !!

65,Tanay J.,"DJ Sushi is not good. The sushi is extremely average, but the portions stand out because they are TINY. The Lion King Roll was about 1/2 the size of others that I've had in the city. 

To give you an idea of the portion size, here is a picture of 3 full rolls of sushi (about $25 worth)... It all fit in one small delicery box...

I would say skip this place and find something with more bang for your buck. If it was this expensive relative to what you get, the quality should be way better.

68,Grace A.,"My partner and ordered in here one night. This place had sub-par sushi -- not good, but not bad. 

We ordered a few of the basic rolls like Alaska Roll (probably the best thing we got but again, it was basic). We also ordered a few specialty rolls like the Lion King Roll (which was our 2nd fave). However, the Spicy Tuna roll was not good at all. Quite dry and fell apart. Also didn't have that much flavor so it ended up tasting like slightly spicy tuna flavored rice and seaweed. 

Stick to the basics here, if anything at all.

Food:

Fuji Mountain Roll: My coworker got this and it came literally on fire. It was a nice touch and she said it was delicious.

Broadway Roll: I thought this roll was really good too. The flavors were delicious. I liked the sauce on top. The food was fresh. 

It doesn't seem like this restaurant should get such a low rating. Maybe it's just a problem with delivery, but it was decent.

We came with a Groupon. We ordered the Tan Tan ramen, F sushi/ sashimi special, Maguro, Hama toro, Sake toro and Sake sashimi. I'm really picky with my ramen. But DJ's was delicious! You get a lightly spiced ramen with an egg, Chashu, corn and small pieces of beef. All of the sushi and sashimi tasted fresh. We loved the toro because of the fatty flavor. I like how this place has all types of Yelp, Groupon and happy hour specials. I'll be back to try some of their sushi rolls and other ramen flavors.

We have lived in the North beach neighborhood for years and it's hard to find good and fresh sushi in the midst of the Italian restaurants and bars scene. We ordered sushi combo B, the classic shrimp tempura roll, and the 49er roll with the standout being the Chicago roll with fresh mango. Everything was spot on! The giant Asahi beers for $6 and white boxed wine (love it!) for $4 was the little cherry on top. No frills, absolutely fresh fish and not crazy SF prices..turn up the beat DJ sushi!

73,Foodie S.,"This restaurant is named under ""Mura Ramen"" in Doordash.  If we have known this, we would NOT order from them.  We had a very negative experience with their food and service in the past.  Today, another negative experience.  We received the food and most of the 3 orders of ramen broth ended up out of their containers and in the bag.  This created a big mess, and at least one of us does not have lunch.  I called the restaurant to let them know about it and I was told rudely that it is not their problem, it is Doordash problem, then hung up on me.  TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.  We could tell that the broth were packaged poorly, and it is not entirely the driver's fault.  If I can give this place ZERO stars I will.   Stay away from this place!!!!!!

83,Pamela B.,"Was in SF for a conference, and was forced to order from here as they were close to my hotel & still open/delivering at 9:30pm on a weeknight

Ordered a spicy tuna roll, Philadelphia roll, hamachi roll w/ lime and an order of escolar nigiri.

Took over an hour for delivery.   Strike one.

The spicy tuna was somehow watery?  Obviously the tuna was frozen and improperly defrosted.  The roll was cut unevenly, 6 or so thin pieces and one random large end piece?  Strike two.

Philadelphia roll had a tiny sliver of cream cheese.  I remember the order form prompting an additional $.50 charge for cream cheese although obviously Philly roll requires it.  Who skimps on cream cheese?  Strike three not even swinging on a lob down the middle.

The hamachi roll was basically inedible and the nigiri was a thing that existed.  Anyway we're out already so no point in elaborating.  I guess I deserved it for ordering from a place that serves both sushi and ramen.

We ended up getting DJ Roll, Sushi Combo F (5 pieces of sushi +  2 pieces of nigiri), and an avocado roll platter with tempura and salad.  They all met expectations! The price was between $13 - $16 per dish, which is why I'd recommend getting a coupon to come. To reach $50, we bought miso soup and wakame salad (seaweed salad: $4) for appetizers and ended with cookies and cream dessert.

The atmosphere felt very rustic and Asian, and the dim lighting gave it a relaxing ambience. But, get a coupon!

The waitress told me that I cannot use it because I have three people, not four. I explained that the voucher should be treated like cash, for $40 value. However, she still insisted that they would not allow us to use it. What a nonsense thing that I had to deal with. Even after I said that my wife is pregnant that could make us a team of four, she still said the voucher was not going to be honored.

We were so hungry at the time so we decided to give this restaurant a chance by paying cash. However, the food was mediocre. We ordered the Tan Tan ramen, tempura ramen. The ramen was very salty. 

In the nutshell, bad customer services and mediocre food.

95,Albert A.,"This is my review for my dinner the other night, Friday, August 25th.
Learned that this was one of the Top 10 Best Sushi Restaurants in San Francisco, which was impressive.  First off, parking is horrendous here.  I suggest getting an Uber/Lyft coming here.
I ordered a Super California Roll and the Spicy Miso Ramen...my ramen took about 10-15 mins to come and the sushi came another 15 mins after that.  Finished my cup of water before the first batch of food came and never got my drink filled again.  Gotta tell you, it was quite the challenge to eat ramen and sushi (dipped in soy sauce & wasabi) without drinking anything! The next time I saw my waitress after serving my food was to hand me the bill.  Not one time did she asked me if I was okay, if I needed anything else, etc.  Paid in cash and the waitress never gave me my change.  Which was cool, I am not gonna make a big deal out of a few dollars, but the decision to tip was taken away from me, and on top of that, upon leaving, the waitress that ""helped"" me all night never thanked me in some form for my business! 

Ramen was delicious, but the sushi was deep fried to death.
Goes to show you that having the best food in town means absolutely nothing when you have staff that couldn't interact with customers to begin with! I wont necessarily stay away from this place, but I wouldn't jump through hoops and the traffic in the city to come here again. 
2/5 stars is generous in my book, considering the bad service and being dehydrated to an inch of my life after the long walk to my car for water.

Then I wait quite a few minutes for my order which is supposed to be preordered and ready to go. I guess the assumption is the make it fresh when I arrive.

We walk in and there is absolutely no one in the restaurant. IN MY OPINION, this is never usually a good sign and I should have trusted my instinct. First of all, we were being taken over at our table by FLIES and GNATS. Seriously?! I had to fight these bugs while trying to enjoy my miso soup. Next, I ordered the bento box which was pretty good despite its small size. One thing I should stop doing, is comparing San Francisco food to food that I can get in any other city for a better price and an actual ADULT SIZE. 

My chicken bento box was pretty small and it kinda pissed me off for the money that I spent on it. Next, we ordered about five rolls of sushi that were pretty good. It all came up to $67 in which I could have totally got the same thing somewhere close to home (Fairfield) for waaaay cheaper. Again, seriously? All the while, I'm fighting flies, gnats & ANTS on my table. One fly had the nerve to land it's little ass on my sushi! I was completely done with this place after that! Definitely not worth almost $70!!!

We arrived a few minutes before opening, and so we just walked around the block waiting for them to open. Once the doors were open, we went right in and were seated immediately. We both knew we wanted Ramen so I did the Pork Belly and Hubby did the Tonkatsu - both in spicy. For a chilly day in SF, it was PERFECT. The flavors were rich and intense and all in all - very delicious. We were pleased! Even though we were there during Happy Hour, we were not allowed Happy Hour prices due to the Groupon - no biggie. 2 Ramens ($10 each plus 1 large beer), ended up being about $33 out the door including tax and tip (so $20 on the groupon and $13 on the credit card). Not too bad for SF - plus a bonus they take Discover Card. We'd be back! The groupon sealed the deal :)

132,John W.,"Most places do state that the Groupon can not be applied to Happy Hours. That is until you've spent the value of the certificate on main courses. Then you can by the bar bite, appetizers, and sometimes drinks at the happy hour price. When we asked for the check, the waitress announced that we were not entitled to the happy hour prices, even though we spent well over the certificate value. On top of that, there was a sign on the wall saying if you check-in on FaceBook or Yelp, you can get a free coke, miso soup, or edamame; so we did. Because we had a groupon, we were not entitled to that either. The place is dirty and there's just stuff out on some of the tables like there stocking up and not ready to open. The beef in the Ramen was tough and the sushi was unremarkable and fell apart easily. There was a sign just inside that stated free Wi-Fi, waitress stated there really wasn't I felt scammed all around.

Bento box was TINY. Thinnest piece of salmon teriyaki ever with the smallest rolls. Thanks for the $12 rice and salad

Service was terrible

137,Nathan C.,"Very over priced for simple rolls. The rolls were pretty much entirely all rice and very little actual fish in them. No soy sauce with delivery either.

138,Jackie D.,"I came here on an early afternoon during the week, and the place was empty, but I assumed that was because they had just opened and it was a random Tuesday. The place was set up in a way that I can picture it being cute and intimate in the evening if it were busier, but this was not the case the time I went. 

I was casually greeted as I came in, solo, to grab a quick bite between meetings in the city, and seated at a booth in the back. The menu seemed to have a good number of things on it, and I settled on one of the sushi/sashimi combos (Combo F). I also redeemed a free miso soup by checking in on Yelp. 

Now the most important point of reviews is on the food and unfortunately, it was just OK for me.... the miso soup came out and it was rather bland and watered down, I feel that either there was not enough miso mixed in it, or it was just not seasoned well cause it didn't have the salty savory flavor that I was craving in a miso soup. The combo came out and the roll itself was good with an appropriate ratio of rice to other ingredients. I also thought the fish tasted fresh and was of good quality. However, the sashimi pieces that came with the combo were very thin and small slices. Not like the ones I see in the photos posted by other yelpers. Perhaps there was a new chef training or something, but I left feeling like I missed out on something. *In hindsight, I should have taken photos of what I got, but like the piglet I am, I just scarfed it down the moment it was placed in front of me.

Bottom line: The entire meal was exactly a 3-star ""just ok"" experience. I'd be interested in coming back again at a more busy time, to see if it is better that that, and if my first trip was a ""just opening up and getting started"" fluke, but with so many other food options in the area, I guess we'll see if that happens.

139,Carina N.,"I ordered their beef teriyaki lunch today via Uber Eat and was so disappointed about the quality of food.  First it took forever for them to prepare the food, that caused a delay in the deliver; then when the food arrived: Sushi was soggy (california roll tasted like paste); the wasabi was bright green in color; Beef teriyaki was super salty and overcooked.  The only decent thing was the miso soup and salad.  They are charging $10 for that. WHAT!

141,Sheena C.,"Today must not be my day for ordering food. This is my second lunch order as the first was a bust from some place else. I ordered the shrimp tempura hand roll (shrimp NOT cooked!), you can see that it's clear and slimy which is not how cooked shrimp should look like! Second I ordered the veggie tempura roll which should have had sweet yam and potato. The veggies in here are orange. I'm assuming it's carrot because it's definitely not soft. It tastes like carrot. Where's the sweet yam and the potato?! Should have known better than to order from a restaurant on Broadway. I may have to stop ordering food from now on. Not cooked shrimp?!? That's outrageous!!

146,S G.,"Ordered sushi from here last night and it was terrible.  Barely any fish in the sushi and the Edamame was served cold and it was not cheap.  I was very disappointed.  Ordered spicy tuna roll... cant see barely any tuna just all rice.

148,Steven H.,"Ordered via EAT24 delivery through Yelp. Ramen broth arrived luke warm and it was flavorless. Sushi combo was not well made (pieces fell apart) and the rock n roll tasted funny, as if the eel was not fresh. This is mediocre food at best. Look elsewhere.

I recommend the 49er roll for a refreshing flavor. And they are so quick to make your order wether you are dinning in or placing a to go order.

152,Deah D.,"Seriously? When you wait over an hour for delivery after requesting extra soy sauce and the food finally shows up with NO SAUCE? messaged Eat24 furious about it. The restaurant called me and started giving me the run around. Terrible customer service ordered once before and was ok with it.. but after today NEVER AGAIN. BTW its been 2 hours and 11 minutes.. and they just brought the sauce.

157,M. K.,"Haven't been here for a while.  Most of the servers were different.  I think they are under new management!!??  The menu is different.  My hubby ordered udon and CA roll, my sister-in-law ordered a sushi plate, and I had chicken teriyaki.  The CA roll came out, then the udon, then the sushi plate.  Hubby and sister-in-law were almost half done and I still haven't received my dinner.  It was obvious I was just sitting there and a server asked me what did I order.  She went to the back and a couple of minutes later came out with my food!  Who knows what happened but they need to time it so that all of the entrees come out the same time!  The food is good...  nothing special but it's satisfying.

159,Emily S.,"I ordered through eat24 and my order was suppose to be delivered to me by 8:30... My order did not come until 9:10 and I ordered my dinner at 7:45... I even called the restaurant at 8:45 and the lady said oh we just sent the delivery guy out he should be there in 10 min which became 20min later... My order consisted of 2 bowls of ramen, one for me and one for a friend, 2 order of sushi rolls and seaweed salad. Seaweed salad was ok, but the rolls... $4 for one roll each and it was those hand rolls I one seaweed... Not a long one cut into pieces... They weren't that big either... What a rip off... Next up, the ramen... Ok ramen is better fresh and not delivered ok, but the soup didn't even have flavor and I asked for spicy on both and it wasn't even spicy. The noddles tasted like instant noodles and the texture felt like that too. It was all clumped up together even when I poured my soup in it... Bad delivery and estimated time and no flavor in the soup and what a rip off on the sushi
