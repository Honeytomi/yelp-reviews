1,Michael N.,"A big thank you to Mona Lisa in North Beach for the delicious food, we ate it in their car out in front. It was so romantic and a lot of people were walking by taking pictures. We sang some songs to them while we ate. It was so much fun.

The owner Maurizio is a really sweet guy, he's been so kind to us since we started going there 3 years ago. We had never dined in the car, but he convinced us and we didn't regret it! We got a pizza, a pasta and a salad. Just the right balance. And Maurizio was teaching us some Italian while we were in the car. So fun!!!

It's definitely something every San Franciscan or tourist should do at least once is their life! You won't regret it!!!

Sincerely,

2,Meredith P.,"Mona Lisa is a very fun/lively restaurant with really good food! The menu is vast and ranges from pasta and pizza to seafood that looked (and smelled) amazing. 

We had feasted at lunch, so unfortunately we were not starving when we got to dinner, but we ordered bruschetta and a salad to start with and both were delicious and a large helping. The bruschetta was nice and crispy and full of flavor. We got a salad with the italian dressing and while it was good, there was just a tad too much dressing on the salad for our liking. 

I ordered the penne arrabbiata and it was huge and delicious. My husband ordered the Mona Lisa pizza and it was loaded with the toppings and the crust was good. The table behind us got a huge bowl of what looked like mussels and they looked amazing - next trip, definitely will come back for these. 

The service was good/hand's off which was nice - they didn't seem to be rushing us out the door even though there was a wait to get in. Will be back next trip to SF and recommend for a good, relatively priced meal in North Beach.

3,scott h.,"A solid four stars. 

The fried calamari was excellent. it was perfectly seasoned, and ultra tender. And it was obviously it's very fresh.

Margherita pizza met expectations, but nothing special.

I dined outside on the sidewalk. The weather is nice, this is the only way to go. 

At times I got the feeling the staff was more interested in collecting customers off the sidewalk than attending to the ones they had.

4,Julie K.,"Mona Lisa's pasta is amazing! There's a wide range of items on the menu and I got the spaghetti carbonara and it was delicious 
pros: 
-pasta is very fresh
-sauce isn't too greasy or too thick but just the right amount of seasoning 
-i can tell the pasta is really good quality and the chefs took a lot of time to craft each dish 
-it tasted like authentic italian food and is worth coming again
cons: 
-we had a reservation but had to wait an additional 30 minutes 
-the pasta took about an hour to come out
-the pasta was delicious but the long wait made me take off a star

5,Lilly K.,"STOP READING RIGHT NOW AND JUST GO! 

But if you must read let me tell you, this place is hands down A-MAZING. I used to work in North Beach and would often pass Mona Lisa on my commute, they typically have this adorable little Fiat parked out front. (How can you miss it when you're on Columbus Ave!) 

Fast forward to this weekend, it was my boyfriend's birthday and he's new to San Francisco. I wanted to do something extra special for him and the first thing that popped into my head was the little car outside of Mona Lisa! I called the restaurant and set up a reservation for 8pm. 

THIS is where the impeccable service started. From the owner Mauricio seating us in the little car, setting up the table and taking our pictures, to our server going above and beyond to make sure we had an incredible experience. 

For this dinner we ordered: 

Family Style Antipasti - A gorgeous display of bruschetta, meats, cheeses, and olives, SO GOOD.
Bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon Kith and Kin - Excellent choice with pasta
Spinach ravioli with a bolognese sauce - DELICIOUS. The sauce is so rich and flavored so well.
Linguine with clams - My boyfriend said it was amazing.

Topped off with a birthday Tiramisu that was to die for! 

Seriously, if you made it this far without closing the Yelp page and heading straight to the restaurant, then you really didn't want pasta that bad.

6,Carly C.,"Food was amazing and came in very large portions. The seafood pasta was loaded with shrimp, mussels, clams and calamari and of course extra parmesan ;) The calamari in the pasta was slightly undercooked, but overall the dish was great. Atmosphere is fun and great for a weekend dinner spot! They have murals on the ceiling, lots of pictures and sculptures throughout the inside. 

FYI this restaurant does not honor reservations for some reason. We booked our reservation on Yelp for 8:15 pm, but when we arrived we were added to the same list that walk-in customers were added to. We ended up waiting 40 minutes to be seated, which was quite unfortunate because it was our anniversary dinner! 

On a whole, great food and restaurant, but don't expect timely seating/service.

It's warm and inviting, and the owner is there commanding everything from the floor, which lets me know he takes extreme pride in his restaurant!
Will definitely go back!

8,Laneisha T.,"Came to Mona Lisa this past weekend for my 30th birthday (June 2019). This happened to be the weekend of the north beach festival so the restaurant was pretty busy all day, we walked by earlier in the day seemed like a steady flow of people. We had a reservation and we were seated pretty quickly. We were seated by the kitchen and were able to watch the chefs in action as they prepared different orders it was awesome!! 

We ordered some Bruschetta which I thought was verryyy tasty some in my group (party of 5) thought it was too much tomato but I think that's just personal preference! To me it was perfect and had a wonderful flavor!! I also ordered the calamari which was cooked very nicely not chewy and was light and crisp and the marina to go with it! YUM! I almost ate the whole order by myself! For dinner I got the Aldon Smith pasta which I thought was rather tasty! So good! My bf got the pizza and my other guests got chicken dishes and lasagna and everyone really enjoyed their food!! It was sooo good! My only regret is we were too full for dessert so I'll definitely be back!!!

9,Rohit K.,"One word: roaches. 
We had just finished the bread and a roach appeared just as our food was being served. We requested to move to another table. To our disappointment, we found a roach on that table too! What was worse was that it was climbing all over an open olive oil bottle. Despite this, instead of apologizing, the manager actually told us "" not to create too much of a scene"" or "" I'll seat you outside"".
After this, getting to the food was the last thing on our mind.
Strongly recommend an avoid on this one.

10,Alice L.,"The owner here has a lot of spunk. He even has a large B&W portrait of himself when he was younger. You can play ""ispy"" for it amongst all his other photos while you wait for a table. 

I made reservations for dinner on the day of. I was seated about 10 minutes after my reservation time, so not too bad. 

They serve complementary bread before the meal. It was cold bread, but hey it's free, right? The servers here may take some time to get to you, but I went during peak hour. 

Cioppino-- So effing delicious! The tomato sauce had so much flavor in it, especially shellfish. The bread is amazing for mopping up this sauce. This dish will set you back like $50, but it's meant to be shared.

Ravioli-- My boyfriend didn't really like this. 

Squid ink risotto-- This dish was very one-dimensional. Would not recommend. 

Pasta with white wine and shellfish-- Seafood was very fresh on this dish, however the pasta was under-salted. There were sun-dried tomatoes on this dish (I believe) and they were loaded with salt. It's like you sometimes get a bite of bland or a bite of salty. 

Bottom line-- Just go with the cioppino.

11,A.v. N.,"Oooh, found ourselves a new go-to spot in the City! We go to Chinatown semi-regularly but don't often venture along Columbus Ave. I wanted to see the National Shrine of St. Francis of Assisi and explore some Italian places along the way. It's right across the street from the Shrine.

I was in a carbonara mood, the wife was in a seafood mood, and the Boy was in an indecisive mood. The waiter Gian Carlo was so friendly and engaging with our Boy, gave him a choice of a couple pastas, a choice of sauce, meat or no meat, and what to drink. Excellent service.

My carbonara was delicious, and I shared some with my Boy who wished I had saved him more. He should've listened to me the first time when I told him to get the carbonara. Kids, listen to your parents. Unless they're vegan. In which case, insist on the carbonara. Trust me.

The wife's seafood pasta was also excellent. She let me try some/finish it off. I would have tried dessert too if I hadn't finished off their plates because I didn't feel like carrying around a to-go bag. I cleaned up all the sauces with the bread too because, hello, Italian restaurant. It would be rude if I didn't.

We'll definitely be back and will make a point to leave room for dessert.

Also, if you can, sit by the window because it's brighter; inside was a bit dim. Outside looked nice too, and you're in the shade by the late lunch hour.

12,Emily A.,"Cute little restaurant on the corner of Columbus St. 
The servers and owners are OG Italians.. great service.
We decided to opt in for some pizzas. We got the Mona Lisa and the Piemonte. Both delicious and fresh. Highly recommend the Piemonte if you like truffle. The red wine (Cabernet) was imported from Italy, also delicious. I would definitely come back and I highly recommend if you're craving some good ole fashion carbs!

13,Susanne R.,"As Nat King Cole sang, ""Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, men have loved you..."" and I love you too!!

We'd made early reservations here after a matinee show.   Walked in and were warmly greeted.   They were not busy so we could pick where we wanted to sit.  I choose the back half of the house as it was darker and my friend was fighting a migraine.    

After being seated with menus, water and bread soon followed.    It took us awhile to make food decisions as the menu is very extensive.  We decided on appetizers and  drinks , then ordered our mains.   The waiter Antonio was fantastic.   Showed up when we needed and checked back at appropriate times.

Appetizers 
Burrata Fresca-  perfect combination of fresh burrata with prosciutto, arugula and Parmesan 
Aglio Siciliano Caramellato- sautéed garlic cloves in wine and Parmesan..  DELICIOUS 

Mains- 3/4 were fantastic, the last dish was just ok.
Spaghetti alle Vongole 
Spaghetti allo Scoglio
Chicken Parmesan 
Salmone con Gamberoni alla Crema

Desserts -  these were amazing!!  Fresh, lovely flavor combinations.  The parfait is a must...
Panna cotta
Lemon sorbet 
Cream de limoncello parfait 

Service was efficient and friendly.  Everything was wonderful.  We throughly enjoyed our time and will be back.

They said sure give us 10 minutes! Sure enough before we knew it we were given the best seat in the house! The service and food were phenomenal! I'm a sucker for Italian food and this was probably one of the best! The owner treated us like family and was the kindest man! We will definitely be back!

15,David N.,"DELICIOUS! The Mona Lisa has an amazing menu, all done very well and very authentic! I have been here a hand full of times and every time is a treat. I really can't pick a favorite dish but you have to try the antipasto tower. The wait staff is extremely accommodating and the host makes you feel like your the most important person in the world. Highly recommend the Mona Lisa if your looking for an all arround great experience. Amazing food, wine, and italian hospitality. Perfect for a romantic date but with a more relaxed atmosphere.

Ok I had to come back here and edit this because I think I found my new favorite dish bistecca Al porcini, I normally go for the more traditional dishes but I was craving a steak.. and WOW! cooked perfectly, flavors were out of this world!

The food was all solid and I really like the atmosphere here...perfect place to enjoy a long, relaxed meal over a couple bottles of wine. 

We split the bruschetta and prosciutto-wrapped cantaloupe. Both were good. For mains, we split multiple of the pasta dishes. I enjoyed them all but the tortellini was probably my favorite. Would recommend!

18,Chaheti B.,"Transported into Italy!! Don't let the super touristy location of the restaurant deter you from coming in, the food is authentic and the menu is extensive. It is a bit tight and we were seated in a corner by the window on a table too small for our food and wine, but we still loved the atmosphere. 

Make sure you make reservations because it's usually packed with a line of people waiting outside!

My boyfriend is gluten free and it's usually rare for an Italian restaurant to have homemade GF pasta, let alone GF RAVIOLI. You couldn't even tell the difference. The sauce was extremely garlic-y but we loved it. 

The lobster ravioli was delicious and creamy as well.

We also ordered a plate of the chicken cioppino with risotto but we had 2 bites of it because our ravioli dishes were a lot larger than what we were expecting. The risotto had lots of veggies, however the only flavor that was coming across the dish was salt and the super salty olives. We ended up packing it up and giving it to a homeless person because we didn't enjoy it enough to even have at home. 

Oh and their bread is incredible, crunchy, and warm!

The service is great here! All the employees here are very friendly and truly make you feel welcomed! 

The food was delicious!!!  The menu had so many options that it took me a while to decide what I wanted. I couldn't decide if I wanted pasta, lasagna, pizza, or the other delicious items they had on the menu. I ended up ordering a cheesy pasty and my god was it cheese heaven. I added a bit pepper to give it a kick and it hit the spot! My husband ordered the margarita cheese pizza and he loved it. I had a slice of his pizza and I was tempted to order another one. The crust, the sauce, the cheese, the basil, the roasted tomatoes on top was exquisite. 


My husband had traveled to Italy not too long ago and he mentioned that the penza(pizza) has the same authentic taste as it does in Italy! 

I highly recommend this cute and cozy restaurant.

25,Clarissa C.,"Yum! Great Italian food in North Beach!

Mona Lisa is one of the many restaurants in North Beach I just found out you can count on for good Italian food. From the tourists coming in just from foot traffic, as well as regulars, I would say it's definitely wise to make a reservation ahead of time. 

The atmosphere is lively and bustling, with waiters and tons of people trying to squeeze and get by with food. Fun paintings/photos and marble busts in police officer hats also line the restaurant walls, giving you something to look at as you wait for your table or dinner. 

One of the highlights if you want to try all the appetizers and turn heads is their grand Family Style Antipasti ($31.95). It's a crazy, multi-tiered vessel that barely fits on the table and is awesome if you like calamari and proscuitto! They say it feeds two, but honestly could feed 4 (especially with their large pasta entrees).

I got the Rigatoni all Borrelli ($25.95) and it was definitely delicious. It came on a hot dish with plenty of tomato sauce, melted cheese, eggplant, and rich/slightly spicy sausage mixed throughout. The Garlic Bread we ordered on the side was also great--super garlicky and toasty! With all that food, you better believe I had a hearty full meal of takeout for the next day. 

Overall, I thought all the food here was super spot-on. The Italian manager and owner is super funny (and hunting for some good Yelp Reviews lol), and the service was pretty great given how packed it was for a Friday night. I would say the prices are definitely on the more expensive side for Italian food here, but I guess it comes with the location in SF. Would definitely come back if I was going for a nice Italian dinner and trying to wow some SF visitors!

I wasn't impressed this time, the pasta was bland, lacked flavor and taste, it was not very tempting. Moreover the Scolio spaghetti wasn't of the quality as I would have expected. The service and staff was good though, place is good not sure why the quality isn't constant.

29,Jennifer O.,"Other than Sam's Grill, there's no other restaurant in San Francisco that can greet you as an old friend and immediately make you feel welcome and at ease. 

Mona Lisa is special, they just try harder and everything is made with love. I wanted a dish they no longer had on the menu (been gone too long) and they made it up for me, off menu, including a generous shaving of truffles and truffle oil.

The menu is enormous but nicely broken down by pastas with meat, fish, vegetarian making it easier to narrow your choices. 

The fried calamari appetizer was solid and they crafted a deluxe plate of bruschetta with mortadella, caprese salad and kalamata olives for our table all because (I suspect) I told a man perusing the menu outside, ""Go! I'm a local and I love this place!""

My child's carbonara was sinful and delicious with a generous amount of pancetta; my friend's son devoured his pasta arrabiata, fragrant with basil, and I enjoyed my specially prepared dish.

Sure, I could nitpick that the tomatoes on the Caprese could've been juicier and I would've liked a bread plate and freshly ground pepper but as I wended my way through the cozy dining room with its busy and eclectic decor, I said thank you and goodnight to the owner, a man I felt I'd known forever. 

It was as if we just had a wonderful meal at a friend's home.

It's more than good food that fills your soul and having dinner at Mona Lisa was a comforting and joyful experience.

The place is pretty cool.  Sculptures, sculptures with hats (SFPD hats, etc) on, and Italian art.  This place is great for big groups too.

We ordered different Italian dishes.  But first we had this all kinds of appetizers (calamari, bruschetta, etc) on a tiered platter.  The appetizer is delicious.  The individual meals we ordered all looks good and delicious.  I especially like the chicken that my cousin ordered.  I ordered pasta with pesto sauce (the veggie menu) I figured we got the appetizers with meat and seafood already so I want to  be healthy LOL.

The seafood Cioppino tastes bland and the fish/shellfish was not fresh even for frozen food standard. On the contrary, the price they charges on this dish was actually a little bit higher than the other good restaurants in the same neighborhood. 

I can't understand how this place got such a high rating? Nothing personal about this place but the food was over truly overrated and I will never recommend friends to here for the sake of my own foodie reputation

We made a reservation, but unfortunately due to technical issues, there was a tad bit of confusion and we were delayed a few minutes.

And guess what? The owner (or manager) on duty was super chill and down to Earth about this entire hiccup. Since this was a surprise birthday, we were on a clock and he somehow made magic happened. I was literally impressed.

I ordered the Spaghetti Allo Scoglio, which had huge portions of calamari, clams, mussels and prawns. It was solid. I wish the sauce was a tad bit thicker, but overall, the dish was a delight. You could really taste the authentic seafood (or ocean flavor) with each bite. The noodles were perfectly cooked at al dente. 

We also ordered the Mona Lisa pizza and the calamari appetizers too, which were delicious as well.

Was it the best Italian food I have ever had? No. But what really separates Mona Lisa from every other restaurant is their unique and five-star dining experience. The staff and restaurant management team really went up and beyond to make our group of 11+ guests feel special.

Mona Lisa, I'm a total fan and would come here again in a heartbeat.

38,Lauren S.,"After a long day of roaming the streets of Dan Francisco with our dog, we decided to find a dog friendly place to sit down and fill our belly.  We stopped at this place because it was the first place with outdoor seating.  We were not disappointed.

We ordered a veal with capers to share, kids pepperoni pizza, and spaghetti meatballs for kids.

Veal was delicious and not over powered by the capers.  It was lightly salted and not greasy. We cleared our plates.  My younger son loved the pizza and said it was cheesy and.plenty of pepperoni to pick at.  He said he could eat at this place again.  My older boy enjoyed his spaghetti and meatballs and thought it was meaty with a sweet balance of the sauce.

Wine by the glass was reasonable and good pour. 

Lastly,  service was excellent and couldn't ask for more attentive service,  especially since we were far removed from the hustle and bustle of the core restaurant seatings inside.  My husband said we should get discount for advertising outside with the yummy food to passerbys.

I totally recommend this place and return again. Thumbs up!

After trying another Italian restaurant nearby that wouldn't seat me at a table (I was traveling solo, and they wanted me to sit at the bar, instead of take up an entire small table meant for two or more. Their right, but I didn't want a bar experience.) I decided to stop in Mona Lisa after having walked by more than a few times over the weekend. 

Monday night and it wasn't too crowded. The staff were super friendly and very professional. 

I started with the excellent bruschetta and a glass of Chianti Classico (also excellent). For an entree, I had the veal ravioli and it was it amazingly good! I love ravioli, it's one of my favorite foods, and Mona Lisa's version was one of the best I've had in a restaurant in the US.

I loved the entire experience! I can't wait to return next time I'm in San Francisco!

Pasta with pink sauce for kids - a bad version of penne a la vodka

48,Tinyee H.,"If you want traditional Italian-American food, look no further. The leather-bound menu had many choices. We ordered the calamari fritti, buffalo fresca on greens, spaghetti with meatballs and rigatoni osillio. The fried calamari was a bit under seasoned, i.e. not enough salt. The buffalo mozzarella was creamy and soft, and went well with the prosciutto and arugula. The kids likes the meatball. The rigatoni osillio had a fresh-tasting basil pesto with grilled chicken. This was my favorite out of all dishes, and also one of the best I've had. It was not too oily from the pesto and the chicken was perfectly cooked and moist.

Our waiter, Luca, was charming and pleasant. The restaurant still had holiday decorations and was a bit tacky. I don't get the air force theme with captains hats on busts. Clearly the restaurant has been visited by famous people as portraits line up all around the dining area.

49,Mary K.,"After a longest day of work, I was in a needed for a comfort food, more specifically an Italian food and I searched for a restaurant that is open this late. Most restaurants in SF tend to close after 9pm and would shoo new patrons away upon their closing hours.
Behold, it is Mona Lisa's restaurant that I found, which happens to be the perfect Italian spot in SF that does stay open until 11pm. 
It is cozy and their interior designs are beautiful too. It
I had truly enjoyed observing & checking out these ancient pictures on their wall.

Their extensive menu offers so many & ""looks delicious"" food options and it took me a good while to decide on which one to try. I finally settle for Burrata Fresca: Fresh italian farm burrata mozzarella with prosciutto crudo di parma, arugula, and shaved parmigiano, it's an appetizer by the way! 
and main course- Lasagna: Homemade lasagna with fresh mozzarella in a ground pork, beef, and tomato meat sauce. 

All were very tasti-licious along with the fresh breads! 

The owner and the waiter were excellent with their services toward me. Had a great conversation with the owner, he is a warm-heart man & he will also fill you in on his family's heritage background. 
Mona Lisa feels like a home to me. Great place to eat at and I will come back again.

Thank you!

50,G M.,"We were wandering around North Beach for Memorial Day today and decided to try Mona Lisa because the Yelp reviews were strong.  It certainly had the risk of being a tourist trap being on Columbus so close to Broadway, but I don't want to be one of those San Franciscans who's lived here forever but still hasn't done what many tourists have.

I had the Pinsa, Napoli style.  It's an oval-shaped pizza with special blend of all non-GMO soy, wheat, and rice flour.  I thought the crust was the best I've had in SF.  Nice and crispy, but still light.  It's not like true Neapolitan pizza, which is wet and has to be eaten with knife and fork, but these days I like the way Mona Lisa does it better.

This is not a cheap place (with many entrees in the $30+), but the portions are huge, so it's not so bad if you end up taking a bunch home like we did.  

Glad we dropped by.

Bread is chewy and fresh but we left room for dinner! We had the four cheese pizza which is hands down one of the best pizzas I've  ever had! The flavor of the cheeses are outstanding and you can taste each one! Crust is crisp and light. We also had the Chicken Milanese with garlicky spinach. Chicken was perfectly cooked and very good. We had the linguini and clams which was flavorful and plentiful. The Caico e Pepe pasta was also outstanding. Service was friendly and very efficient. We can't wait to go back! Don't miss this!

My dinner had more juicy, tender clams than I've ever had. They have an extensive wine list, too.  I enjoyed the house chianti, very flavorful.  And to our surprise, they brought a complementary crème brule with a candle for my hubby's 70th birthday!

I made a reservation for 11:30 PM, we got there around 11:15 and the guy seemed a little hesitant to take us until I told him I had a reservation. One thing I love about the menus are that it shows you what dishes they have for vegetarians, meat options, and seafood (etc) which is awesome and way less confusing. We ordered a cheesy penne pasta, ravioli, bruschetta, salad, and desert. The food was hot and made fresh which was perfect. The tiramisu and other deserts were mouth watering.

The food was good, I had the penne pasta with spicy sauce which was vegan approved. No cheese, had mushrooms and eggplant. The plates look small but they are deep so it is actually a lot of food.

73,Ellen H.,"It was Valentine's Day and every restaurant was full of couples looking lovely into each other's eyes. We needed a late night dinner spot  without having made a reservation beforehand, yikes. What seemed like an impossible task was made very easy by Yelp Reservations. We did a quick search, were able to make a reservation around 10pm and were seated immediately upon arrival in a still busy restaurant. 

The staff was very courteous and friendly, which was very surprising after what must have been one of the busiest evenings of the year. Two minutes after being seated, we had already received yummy bread and our orders had already been taken.

We were a party of 4 and we each ordered different dishes, from eggplant parmigiana to pizza to pasta. EVERY single dish was amazing! While we are spoiled with good Italian restaurants in this area, Mona Lisa very much impressed me. They serve exactly the type of cheesy, homey, hearty food that I want when stepping into an Italian restaurant. It does not get better than this.

We decided not to dine here and went to another Italian restaurant @ the corner of Columbus and Stockton which had EXCELLENT SERVICE AND GREAT TASTING FOOD!  

I can just imagine what the rest of our dining experience would have been like if we decided to dine @ Mona Lisa.  Do yourself a favor and skip this establishment since there are many other better service oriented restaurants in the area.

78,Michelle C.,"In one word I would have to say... disappointing. Our fellow Yelpers let us down with this one. We are having a hard time understanding why anyone would describe this restaurant as romantic and cozy. In my opinion it's loud and garish, which is fine if that's what you're looking for.  Loud Italian rock covers.  My husband described it as 80s music covered in Italian. 

I will say we were sat rather quickly (it was also a Tuesday night)

The bread was just ok.  My next clue that we were not in for what we were hoping for was the wine.  It was way over priced. I opted for a glass of the Cabernet that had no name on the menu.  It tasted like it was watered down.  I would have been better off with two buck chuck.  

Service was slow. My food was delivered at least 10 minutes before my husband's, which was odd since it was just the 2 of us. 

I got the lasagna which was salty and bland.  I ate half and left the rest behind, which I never do.  Lasagna is best the next day but there was no redeeming this lasagna.  

My husband got the gnocchi, which was horribly undercooked and had a gummy texture.  

Our waiter was nice enough and apologized for the wait but he never really checked to see if we needed anything.

Decided to eat with my friends on a Monday evening. We so happen to be in the area, and we were intrigued to come here because of the reviews and ratings on Yelp! 
Honestly my SF Yelpers let me down on this one! 
Service was ok. Once we're arrived we were friendly greeted and sat down immediately. The restaurant was not busy whatsoever, there were around 3-5 tables at most, which does not consider a restaurant to be busy, but yet our service took a while! At first we thought they forgotten about us, we were new to the restaurant, so this means we took a while to decide what to get. Not once did our server come to check on us if we had any questions. Disappointing. 
Finally! When our server came. The first think I asked was, what's a popular dish you guys serve here? He immediately said the Lasagna. I trusted him. And ordered it!  My friends ordered pizza. 
OUR FOOD! 
Nothing was appealing. Nothing was tasty! 
I promise you people, I love my savory food. But my Lasagna was full of salt! It was soggy. It had not taste what's so ever. A frozen lasagna from Costco probably tastes better than this Lasagna. 
Nonetheless, my friends pizza taste like in quote tastes ""like I bit into a piece of pure garlic"" but ""the crust is nice"" 
Truly disappointing. I am so sorry Mona Lisa, but you deserve 1 Start for at least trying. 
Overall, if a Italian place butchers the pizza, you know it will not be worth your time and money.

As things go, Little Italy is predominantly eateries and cafe's.  Living the Dolce Vita!

Where to go for dinner.  Choppino is pretty San Fran iconic - like their sourdough clam chowder.  There are plenty of places that make Choppino and prices vary but expect to spend around $50.  The seafood varies too.

Mona Lisa is pretty lively.  Plenty of people dining and enjoying their meals.  Might as well go in and see what it's like.  The place is a little dark for my liking but ambience chirps up as you look around at all the celeb pix and memorabilia.

Ordered the Choppino and the Diavolo Pizza.  Pizza was good.  The crust was delicious - I'm not a crust guy...just a crusty guy!  :)

The Choppino could have been better.  Many other places use crabs or lobster to enrich the flavour.  Not here.  Up to you if you want to spend the $50 for it.

Service was great, food was good, wine was fine.

It has been truly amazing to get to celebrate our anniversary each year at Mona Lisa Restaurant.  I brought my wife to this little piece of Italian Heaven almost 20 years ago and it continues to be our favorite place to eat in San Francisco.  Delicious food paired with phenomenal service. You do feel like you are treated like family by Maurizio and his entire staff.  We started off with some mouth watering Bruschetta and topped of the dinner with an Italian rum cake that definitely didn't disappoint.
Thanks again for a wonderful evening! See you again very soon

But be prepared, if you want to order wine, your best bet is ordering a bottle. They have a terrible wine by the glass list! They also brought out bread that was a major joke (stale, and certainly not made there). I wouldn't recommend going for a super nice wine and pasta night if you don't plan to order by the bottle. We sat outside so we didn't get the atmosphere of the restaurant- but it seems very family oriented/classic authentic Italian. I had the veal ravioli and it was EXCELLENT! The portion size was perfectly controlled despite that meant the dish was on the more expensive side. I wish they had side salads and soups as an option for a starter but that didn't seem available to me. I also didn't think that their dessert menu was anything to write home about. Go for the pasta!

So when we asked to take the last bottle home with us after discussions back and forth the waiter emptied  the bottle in the back and then put it in a paper bag and gave it back to us with a straight face insisting it had been empty when we opened the bag and found the empty bottle.

We came through the door on a night that I was sure we might not even get in. We were greeted by Maurizio Flores. After I was seated I found out he was the owner. This gentleman understands the true art of greeting each guest with a warm sincere welcome. That alone starts your food journey for the evening on the right foot. 

The restaurant itself is cozy and warm. All of the pictures on the wall remind me of Satdi's restaurants in New York City. I am told all the famous pictures are at the owner's friends and people who have eaten here. The picture over our table is one of the late and great Prince. I had the opportunity to cook for him for 2 weeks.  The lights hanging in the middle of the restaurant reminds me of our flat we had for a week in Positano

We were seated in the section of Joseph B
Luca M. Wow!!!  The genuine care and comfort of their guests is their highest mission. I feel like we could be one of the few tables of English speakers.  Watching these charming waiters crossing over from Italian to English to give perfect service to each and every table. 

We started our first course with the calamari and it was fried to perfection. This is not one of these overly breaded bowl of rubber bands. How could we not have bruschetta as well. Beautiful, tasty and not a treat to be missed. 

We had the meat lasagna and the house pizza. Unfortunately, they took away the menu for me to describe perfectly how they prepare the dough. 

Thank you! Thank you!! Thank You Joseph B

My bf and I came here today to celebrate our anniversary swayed by the overwhelming number of good reviews from this restaurant. As we were eating our food, I saw a cockroach run across our table. We brought it to the attention of our waiter and he responded with, ""Yeah the cockroaches are running away because we have been fumigating the restaurant....."" Only later adding that, "" that the cockroaches came from the restaurants over there *pointing across the street.* The waiter failed to demonstrate any concern about the health implications of cockroach infestation. If anything it seemed like the waiters was attempting to justify or normalize the situation. After the incident, we decided not to even finish our meal, asked for the check, paid and left. The waiter even had the audacity to ask if we still wanted desert, however, did not bother to apologize for our unpleasant experience. We are not the typical customer that this establishment caters to, my bf and I are Latino. We can't help to think that this could be a factor in why this incident was not taken seriously.

The location is good.  It's a tourist trap, but if you want to eat in this neighborhood on Columbus, you are likely to eat in a tourist trap.

The restaurant was very crowded, that's good, but it made it very difficult to hear other people in our group of six.  The restrooms were clean.

The starter, a three-tiered plate of antipasti, which had excellent variety and good quality.  I suppose it was a little awkward to dip the fried calamari in the bowl of sauce, as things didn't really fit on the table right.  If I came back I'd order this again, but if with five or more I'd get a second dipper of sauce for the calamari.

Our entrees were mediocre.  I had veal scallopini.  It was very basic, just the veal, sauce, proscuitto, over wilted spinach with a few potato wedges on the side.  Presentation was bland.  The guy to my left had the mussels, and he reported meh.

Here's the big problem though: the bill was too high for what we got. $300 for six people, two of whom were kids, with only one glass of wine among us, not including tip.  Had this been $200 I'd give them four stars, but they just aren't earning their prices.

Maybe just stop by for the antipasti.  It was a fine size for 6 and good and (I think) just $26.  You could get two and a little wine and be pretty happy.

We got there and this man standing outside shrit unbutton he looked sloppy. Had us sit inside wit our baby and the stoller. It was ok because it wasn't busy. We sat and sat and sat till the man from the front finally can wit a water. Just put on the table and walked off talking in some other language. So we waited some more. No one i mean no one said hello be wit you in a moment nothing.. then the waiter came and said "" oh no one knew who was going to take this section so i can help you "" wtf really.. i watched 6 plate's go out of that kitchen b4 he came. Then we asked for a bottle of wine. They were out of 2 top choices. So i closed my menu and we left. Just to the owners of this restaurant....ur staff made me feel very unwelcomed. We ended up going to a much better place..

I must say this is the best Italian I've ever had. I ordered the chicken fettuccine and my boyfriend had the 4 cheese ravioli. Both absolutely exquisite! I really appreciated the wide range of wine selections. Best part of all was the service. The waiters are very attentive and the restaurant owner is a true delight who only wants his customers to have the best dining experience possible. Thank you Mona Lisa's!

107,Victoria K.,"Delicious food and quality service! One of the best restaurants in San Francisco and that's saying a lot. We had the chicken piccata and also a grilled chicken breast as our main dishes.   They both came with super delicious sauteed spinach and potatoes.  

The atmosphere is also fantastic; very unique! Perfect location in north beach. We took a taxi,  so I don't know about the parking situation.  I will say, that it was packed on a Thursday night, though we had a reservation.  I have come here pretty much every time I've been to San Francisco, and it is consistently good.

111,Gaurang K.,"Good food. But extremely poor service by a rude server. 

1) The server arrived 10-15 mins after I sat down. The restaurant was not busy at all.

2) The bread came after the food was served. 

3) The server forgot about my drink. Came after I had almost finished my food. 

4) Server didn't come to check how I was doing during the meal. On 3-4 occasions I had to frantically try to call someone else to get pepper, deserts and water.

5) Server came to pick up the check 10-12 mins after I put the credit card in it.


After I left low tip, the server came and argued with me why did I leave less tip and I respectfully explained the reasons, he got really angry and faught with me.  

It's sad to see such a good restaurant having such a bad server. 

(To the restaurant: server name initials is G. M.)

So many celebrities have been to this place and it's pretty cool that they have pictures of a lot of them hung up in their restaurant. We got a bottle of Chardonnay and it was on the sweeter side but it was still good. I ordered the seafood pasta and it was very delicious, they gave you a really good amount of seafood. We ordered bruschetta as appetizers the tomatoes was so fresh and the bread was the perfect amount of crisp. The customer service was superb but our food did take awhile to arrive and we were getting hungry. Check this place out!

Lasagna was rich, delicious. The Involtini de Melanzane was not as special as I had hoped - lacking flare and that eggplant 'punch' of flavor. The Risotto allo Zafferano was a revelation - the shrimp were very nice and I have never seen a dish so extravagantly seasoned with saffron - excellent! That dish alone is reason enough to return, and we will.

 The bruschetta appetizer was probably the best part of the meal, but again, not anything super special. Overall way overpriced for what you get, even for the Bay Area.

We'd also just barely finished the bruschetta when our pasta was brought out and felt super rushed to get out of there.

123,Holly D.,"I had made reservations for dinner here Friday evening before our Speakeasy experience. I made reservations for 4 of us at 6pm. Our server came to our table quickly and brought us our beverages quickly. However, we did not receive our meal until 7pm. Granted we did look over the menu but it took them well over 40+ minutes to deliver our meal to the table. They did have a large group that showed up 1/2 hour after us and I'm sure this contributed. Since we had to be at the box office at 7:30pm this left us little time to eat. We had just enough time to wolf down our food and pay the bill. Not the best dinning experience for what was to be a special night out with friends. 

The meal itself was delicious! We ordered Chicken Parmigiana and Involtini Di Melanzane. The sauce with both dishes was outstanding yet different from each other. The chicken was tender and succulent, not dry at all. The eggplant was cooked to perfection, firm and flavorful. We would highly recommend both of these dishes.

146,Farzan K.,"I went to this restaurant with a group of 10. Their food is 3/5 and I take one star off for the poor service. A couple of examples: the food was supposed to come with side vegetables but the plate came with side pasta and the waiter told us that they were out of vegetables and he didn't know about it himself. He offered and brought a side ""salad"" instead which was literally only a bunch of shredded lettuce. We also asked the waiter to box our leftover. He then took the plate but never brought the boxed food.

Update: it seems like manager wants to just erase the problem without addressing it. The server did bring pasta as the side instead of vegetables and when we asked he said ""we were out of vegetables."" We then asked why didn't you check with us, to which he replied ""I just found out myself"".

if you are in the mood for some delicious Italian food in San Francisco then this is the place.  Their menu has a wide variety of delicious dishes to suit any appetite and each dinning experience has never been a disappointment. 
One of my favorite plates is the Fettuccine Leonardo. With each bite you can savor the fresh ingredients, the texture of the pasta and the rich creaminess of the Alfredo Sauce ""Heaven"" I tell you. As you sit at your table you can see and smell the food prepared to order. It really adds to experience of dinning at Mona Lisa. 
The Host and it's staff are very polite and at times you can find the Owner himself greeting you or seeing that all your needs are met. It really gives you a feeling of being ""Welcomed"" into their family.

Which are hand made in house daily. *drool* And he started me off with the bruschetta. I'm not going to lie, that little piece of toast with chunks of Parmesan cheese on the side, was the best piece of bread I've had in a long time. Simple. Classic. Amazing. He also recommended the Sauvignon Blanc to pair with my meal, perfection. This restaurant is a home away from home. Easy walk to little Italy and China town. Across the street from St. Francis Cathedral. So I'd suggest a seat outside to enjoy the passers by and see the building in all their glory.

162,Jesse L.,"This is a pretty decent Italian restaurant located in the North Beach area of San Fran.  

We called ahead and asked about reservations.  The lady who answered said ""yes you'll need rev's"".  Then when we said it was for 2 people she said ""just come in soon and we will seat you"".  

We then arrive and get seated immediately. All seams well and no reason to gripe ...until the bread comes.  Maybe it was bad timing or maybe that's the way it is but our bread basket was full of stain, hard to eat bread slices.  We had oil but no peppers or vinegar to dip in.  So we helped ourselves to the empty table next to us. 

So far we aren't to impressed.   Then the meals come.  I got the gluten free Kale ravioli $29 and my wife got the rigatoni alla borrelli $26.  The food was very good but the price doesn't quite add up.  Our server was very good but I can't put her name in this review since nobody where's name- tags.

We ordered a Don Mario pizza, which notes sauce as the first ingredient in its description, and it literally arrived as in the photo - no sauce, entirely tossed, cold and hard. We also ordered ravioli, which was undercooked. All of it was inedible.

When we called the restaurant, they hung up on us. When GrubHub tried contacting them about our order, they didn't even pick up.

GrubHub delivery guy said they only started preparing our order after I called about it being 30 mins late.

Everything about my experience with this restaurant was totally awful.

Update -- 2 weeks after not receiving an update about my refund request, I followed up with the restaurant and the man on the other end basically yelled at me and hung up on me. Customer service does not seem to be valued at this restaurant.

We ordered the fried calamari as an appetizer and it was decent, but nothing special. But that wasn't the issue. For dinner, we each ordered the penne alla vodka. Maybe there was a mistake in the kitchen, such as accidentally spilling all the salt while cooking, but the pasta was literally the most salty dish I've ever had. We had to get gelato after from a nearby spot just to get the salty taste out of our mouths. The next morning my mouth still felt gross. There are plenty of better spots in North Beach, especially for the price.

170,Angelica M.,"Seriously people? I have no idea why this place has such high stars. The service is the absolute worst I have ever experienced in San Francisco! I brought my family to the city, and stopped in to this restaurant, specifically because of the great reviews. I was so disappointed! It took literally 2 hours for hour food to come out, and that was after my asking the server a bunch of times about our food and then got attitude from not only said server but also the owner and the other server working our section. Other tables came and went before our food even came out. I'm not sure if it's because our family speaks Spanish, but one would think that in a place as diverse as San Francisco things like that wouldn't be happening. One thing is for sure I will never eat at Mona Lisa again, and if you're like me and use reviews to make meal decisions, steer clear of this place. It sucks!

Also, bizarrely the sauce was so watery. Not convinced the pasta is really homemade either. My husband had the pasta carbonara, also super bland. Yeah, we didn't even venture to try the desserts we were so disappointed. 1 Star for the meh but free bread and 1 star for service.

Until today Sotto Mare was our absolute favorite, but today we fell in love with Mona Lisa.  A quiet atmosphere with food that was absolutely excellent and our waiter was delightful with a real Italian accent which I found charming when I understood it.  We shared 2 servings of Cioppino for 3 of us (divided by the kitchen) and took home some.  They even had gluten free pasta for my son.  The only slip was missing bread plates and our table could've used a candle.  Other than that I recommend them highly!

As an appetizer, we ordered fried calamari. It tasted bland and rubbery (clearly over cooked). As we were served our entrees, a COCKROACH had appeared to hitch a ride on one of the plates. As soon as the entrees hit the table, it ran across the table and up the wall. Needless to say, we immediately lost our appetites and promptly left the restaurant without taking a bite. DISGUSTING!

196,Joe R.,"As the saying goes third times the charm, well in Mona Lisa's case we'd say the second time it the charm! 

After our last visit (Winter 2017) and my previous review, I will say service has gotten better. Our server Roberto was friendly and attentive and this was a big difference from the last time (which we all still vividly remember)​ to be very different and not for the better; good job Roberto!

The food still extraordinary and flavorful. From the menu we ordered the Carprese Salad, Chicken Marsala, Involtini Mona Lisa, with a bottle of Donna Laura Chianti and split the Raspberry Panna Cota for dessert! The meal totaled $123.53 and while some would consider steep, just remember​ you are in San Francisco, and to eat well, you're gonna pay.

If your looking for for an Italian restaurant​ in Little Italy/ San Francisco that has great atmosphere, good food and good service, give Mona Lisa a try, but we do recommend making a reservation and doing that on Yelp made that a snap!

The caprese salad was good, but had more oil than I would've liked and not enough balsamic (to be fair there's balsamic on the table, so an easy fix). I got the mushroom ravioli based on the waiter's recommendation. It was really good, but sooo rich. I definitely regretted eating all that food right after. Might go back after an intense workout or something when I can handle that level of richness.

200,Victoria Y.,"Came here for lunch because it was walking distance from my office. The restaurant was pretty much empty except for us during a weekday at around noon but we came in anyway after looking at the menu displayed outside. We were seated at a little table by the window as soon as we walked inside. We decided to order the cacio e Pepe and the carbonara. They brought us a basket of bread after taking out orders and there was olive oil and vinegar on the table for us already. The pasta came out pretty fast and the flavors tasted pretty good. My only complaint would be that the spaghetti was cooked for a little too long; I would've preferred a harder, chewier texture but other than that, I really liked it. The carbonara had a good Smokey bacon flavor and the cacio has a nice peppery flavor to it. They also have fresh Parmesan cheese to sprinkle over the top as well.

206,Haltone H.,"Me = medigan who married into wops. I've had a lot of good Italian food, both in Italy and northeastern US.

That said, the entrees were great! The cacio e pepe was perfect. Husband's ravioli had a really fresh and homemade-tasting red gravy.  My extremely picky father-in-law (nothing is like Mama made it) would have loved it.

The negatives: the garlic app was just okay. The bread was very generic, not up to the level of the food. And wine aficionados shouldn't have high expectations here. The rose was acceptable. The pinot noir was extremely bland. Neither was poured tableside, so could have been box wines. Both were ""cooked"" (not kept around 56 degrees), which is pretty common. Possibly the wines by the bottle are better quality/better storage.

Service was decent. Decor was great, which is really why we ended up there though it wasn't necessarily on my 'list'. And the quality of the entrees really made it worth it.

The food was fresh, fast, and phenomenal. The calamari appetizer was too much for one person so my husband shared it with our neighboring table. The house red wine made a nice pairing with our meals.

But it's damn good.  The service is quick and the food is some of the tastiest I've ever had.

The best I have had on the West coast.  We enjoyed the calamari-crispy, fresh, salty and delicious.  The marinara sauce served with the calamari is so good I wanted to eat it with a spoon.  My favorite dish is the spaghetti alle vongole and the combo of spaghetti with the tangy white wine sauce, rich tomato and the clams is the stuff dreams are made of.  My husband enjoyed the cannelloni with sausage and the same delicious marinara.  Everything tastes as though it has been thoughtfully prepared with love all day.

Food was flavorful, and each course did take time to be made, but once they were made they came quick, portions were good, and wine tasted amazing. The food was very filing so I was glad to take some home to enjoy later. 

The staff isn't the friendliest any of the times I've gone, and the restaurant does get busy so they don't get much of a chance to be attentive. 

Expect to be at this restaurant for at least an hour, mostly based off of how long it takes to get served.

for the kitchen staff as they seem to be unable
to perfect any dishes. our complimentary bread was very stale and had to ask for fresh'er' bread. was hoping for a focaccia but it was just your basic slice of bread. had the burrata to start which was served on top of arugula and hidden under loads of prosciutto and parmigiana reggiano. the main focus of the dish is the burrata?? but its plated under a bunch of prosciutto. the dish itself was very unpleasant looking. none of this was dressed in olive oil, balsamic di modena or any type of salt, instead was topped with another cheese... and have table salt available. very confusing and would expect more for +20$. had the gluten free carbonara as my main and it was the worst i've had. the pasta itself had no texture, too over cooked. they didn't cook the egg mixture enough, it was very runny and inedible. on top of that the pancetta served in the dish wasn't even crispy?? i had a few bites and we asked for the bill. my boyfriend ordered a pizza and he hated it how can you fuck up a pizza my guy. the dough was undercooked and overall tasteless with shitty cheese. i was absolutely shocked that they didn't question us as to why we barely touched our mains. but then again after our app we waited a decent amount of time for our mains with our dirty dishes stacked at the side of the table for our sever to come take them, plenty of foh walked past them numerous times and he still brought our mains before clearing the table. 25$ for a glass of pinot and half ass pour beer that was also served in a wine glass and not being asked for another drink. after spending +100 we left our take aways on top of a garbage can hoping someone will find it. they weren't busy, maybe i have high expectations, this restaurant is a disgrace to italian cuisine.

If you are looking for some great authentic Italian food in North Beach or in the city of San Francisco or if your visiting the City for the first time with friends, a family vacation or just looking for a warm tasty dish I highly recommend this great Italian restaurant. With it's great location on Columbus St. it's any easy find and even easier if you spot the owner's very unique 1965 Fiat parked outside. Once inside the restaurant you'll notice it's warm and at home Italian flair. The menu has a great selection of dishes in all categories meat, seafood, poultry and also caters with a huge selection of vegetarian dishes. The prices are quite good too! There is nothing worse than paying for a meal and leaving unsatisfied. Here at Mona Lisa each dish is a very generous serving with some left over to take home if you wish and I did I mention the bread service that will pair well with the bottles of Balsamic and virgin olive oil featured at each table. My wife Kim and I stumbled upon this restaurant after being let down by the food quality, portion size and service from several other Italian restaurants in North Beach, but NOT here at Mona Lisa, it has been our favorite place to eat ever since and we look forward to each dinning experience. After each visit we are left with a great memory of dining there and shouldn't that be what dinning is about as well. Kim's favorite is the Fettuccine ai Gamberoni (Fettuccine in Alfredo sauce with prawns) DELICIOUS! Personally for me when my meat lover's hunger takes over I enjoy Rigatoni alla Borrelli (Rigatoni in a ground pork, beef, and tomato meat sauce with spicy sausage and eggplant) now doesn't that sound good! Lately my favorite dish has been Involtini di Melanzane con Ricotta (rolled eggplant baked with ricotta cheese served with a side of roasted potatoes and sauté spinach) a very affordable dish. Eventually you want to try everything on the menu from appetizers to deserts. So like the song  Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa ...Mona Lisa, you will be singing this song and remembering what a great meal and dining experience you had at San Francisco's own Mona Lisa restaurant. Buon Appetito!

234,E H.,"Mona Lisa is one of the best restaurants I've been to in years. I have been a couple times and always good service and great food. It does get busy so I'd make a reservation. My last order I got to go since I didn't feel like taking a table for just me. It was still delish and great portions of bread and food for me. I recommend this place highly.

We had good service as well- attentive wait staff. And the owner is very friendly and welcoming. If I lived the area, this would be one of my go-to places!

236,Luis C.,"Nice Italian restaurant in Little Italy that had a nice quiet atmosphere. We came on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't crazy packed or busy. The service was decent and the food was good. 
I had the Fettucine Leonardo and thought it was rich in flavor. The sauce was just right. 
 I had a hard time picking what to eat because the menu was FULL of options.
 I recommend the restaurant and hope to return soon

237,Arnel D.,"Surprisingly good restaraunt. 

It's hard to choose a place when you're stuck between Chinatown and Italian-town in San Francisco. Luckily my wife chose the spot and we  were glad we stopped here.

The owner was very welcoming and their staff were great.

The food was delicious and the restaurant had cool decor. 

This place has been here a long time and will be for many years to come. 

I'd visit again when in the area.

It is a busy place and tables are very close to each other so don't plan on having an intimate dinner.

239,Susan C.,"Giovanni, our server, was one of the best parts of the meal. He was very knowledgeable and let me try a few sips of different wines to pick the perfect one for dinner after asking what I liked and didn't like. The menu is extensive and the only problem I had was choosing between items. We started with garlic cheese bread made with fresh garlic. The smell had my my husband closing his eyes, inhaling and smiling. I ordered the classic lasagna and it had an excellent mix of meat to cheese to noodles mix served piping hot and tasting very fresh. I gave part of it to my husband as it was a huge serving and I wanted to save room for dessert. We shared a raspberry panna cotta that was delicious. We finished with a small glass of excellent port and I'm looking foreword to coming back

240,Nathan Anthony R.,"I love this restaurant! I've been here a few times, and have always had a great experience! The last time I was here was with my wife a few months ago, so it has been a while, but we had a very nice experience (Again). We like to dress nice for our dinner outings, I wore a nice blazer with a tie. We could tell immediately that we were being taken care of and made to feel at home at the restaurant! A man who I believe was the owner, gave us each champagne to drink while we waited to be seated. There was a bit of a wait time, but with the complimentary champagne we didn't mind! We were given the best seat in the house! Right by the window facing the street! When we were walking out after enjoying our delicious meal, the owner stopped what he was doing and chatted with us and again made us feel very welcome. Highly recommended!

250,Lisa E.,"Very disappointing now. This was my families go to Italian restaurant in North Beach for 25 years. The inside was cozy and felt very authentically Italian. Now the owner has installed TV screens everywhere which makes you feel like you're in a sports bar, they've put military and law enforcement hats on the busts of all his sculptures and the place is full of pictures of movie stars headshots which is unclear as to why.... So confusing what image they're going for in there now.

In the past the servers offered to grate Parmesan cheese over your dish. Yesterday a bowl of pre-grated Parmesan cheese was just placed on the table like it came out of the jar.

The chocolate profiteroles used to be amazing and now they're just OK. We won't be back. Disappointing.

The place was so fun, but the best part was Maurizo who kept coming out to check on us. Come to find out he was the 4 generation family member of this place. How awesome is that! These are the type of places that we need to patron and preserve from big money corporations taking over. Our tour ended and our tour guide left us, we continued to stay for another bottle of wine and ended with a cannoli. However, it was Maurizo who made the experience the best.

Restaurants should always prioritize reservations with the best sitting. They brought us water and just put it on the table expecting us to pour it. what kind of service is that? Food was mediocre. I can make a tastier pasta at home. The only thing that brought me here is the whole Mona Lisa theme. But I will never come back and I do not recommend this place.

They were super friendly yet very professional, delicious wine and conscious eats. If you are red wine lover do not pass by THE Brunello. Absolutely Delicious! The pasta is definitely the star of the show. Every dish was outstanding and cooked al dente to perfection! Also arrived on our table at the right temperature. The icing on the cake was that, while waiting for our bill to arrive, a server brought little surprise dessert wino. 
Will definitely come back and I'm not just saying that because the music was fire, mostly because the servers were so cute and friendly. Thank you Giovanni, Thank you Mario.               *5 STAR*

268,Alex B.,"Prons: very cozy restaurant with cool interior. 
Cons: However food did not meet my and my wife's expectation. 

Insalata di Spinaci was great, big portion and yummy but a bit too lemony. 

Chicken Marsala was a bit too bitter. Chicken itself was good but could be a bit softer. 

Risotto was ok but rice slightly undercooked. 
Seems like both dishes lacked salt (maybe good, because salt can always be added) but there was no twist or kick or something exciting about them. 

The red Cabernet Sauvignon ordered by glass was not enjoyable, tasted cheap. 

My wife liked Tiramisu, I thought it was OK.

Verdict: maybe we ordered wrong dishes at the place. It was ok but certainly not the experience that would want me to come back and have more.

280,Jackie Z.,"Yesterday a few of us friends felt like enjoying a lovely Italian meal. I recommended Mona Lisa Restaurant, as I have had several yummy experiences at this restaurant before. Before entering my friends and I were scanning the menu located outside of the restaurant. The owner of the restaurant asked how many in our party, then proceeded to offer an appetizer on the house. 

We were seated, ordered beverages, our appetizer (which was ""on the house"") and lastly ordered our entrees. Our waiter was friendly and fast, which was perfect since we were starving! 

ALL of our food was perfect and delicious. No complaints there at all. On the contrary, the ingredients were fresh and rich. 

My issue here was the lack of communication in regard to our appetizer on the house. It was a good 20 min seated, when we ordered our drinks and appetizer. Once our ordered appetizer came out, our server brought an ADDITIONAL plate of bruschetta and said the owner ""also sent you this"". When we got the bill, the bruschetta was complimentary only. We were never asked if that's what we wanted as our complimentary appetizer. To me this smelled like tourist bait and I was extremely disappointed, especially when I was the one to bring my three friends to this restaurant. 

I asked our server and he repeated to me that the bruschetta was the complimentary dish only. Management, please make sure that if an offer will be made to a customer, that the Terms are crystal clear. I took responsibility for paying our non-complimentary appetizer as I didn't want to have a petty argument over an appetizer.

He asked if I wanted something else, & I said no. Then when he brought the check, the pasta charge had not been removed. He was lucky I didn't call the Health Dept.

As for the food, good amount of variety. Huge portions. I do have to mention some inconsistencies.  The first time I came, I ordered the squid ink pasta with calamari, but for some reason it didn't come with the calamari,  so I had to mention this to the waiter and they fixed it. It was great once they got it right. Second time I ate there I ordered the frutti di mare and it came with fish and was missing some items listed in the description. I had to mention this again, so they added the missing seafood, but the fish was left in it so it added a weird flavor and I didn't care for it. The last time I ordered the rigatoni with spicy sausage, meat sauce, and eggplant. The order was right this time, but it was very oily. 

Worth a try, just make sure your dish comes out as described in the menu.

311,Gigi G.,"This place is so romantic and cozy!
I ordered the spinach salad. Walnuts' oily flavor is perfect with sweet and fresh spinach. Cheese is not too heavy and sour.
For the appetizer, definitely try bruschetta! Tomatoes with crispy bread, full of juice!
You can't miss the pasta, too! Just choose whatever you want! They have the best sauces and soft, chewy pasta! 
When the lights were turned on, it looked like an old Italian movie during Renaissance. Yellow, warm lights shined on the old pictures and paintings. You were surrounded by the shades of vintage and smiled, just like Mona Lisa.

313,amanda c.,"The food looked good.  But I didn't stay long enough to try it.  The service was really, really rude.  To the point that after we put in our order, I cancelled it and left.  

After getting conned into entering by a nice man who was sitting outside, we sat and waited.  And waited.  And then waited some more.  When our server finally came to our table, he acted like he was doing us a favor.  When the kid at the table next to us started banging on her table and yelling, I knew it was time to go.

We went across the street to Il Casaro.  A much better experience!

315,Gene D.,"I had to take off a star due to the service received the evening we dined there.  More on that later.

The decor is your classic North Beach fare.  It was stuffed full of decorations, etc.  Some would call it gaudy while others would call it classic/typical of the area.  i would agree with the later.

The food had its share of hits and misses.  My Chicken Saltimbocca was surprisingly good.  It was simply prepared with roasted potatoes and sauteed spinach.  The chicken was moist while the prosciutto and sage offered delicious contrasts to one another.  The sauce/juice that was present had a good flavor profile to it.  The spaghetti Carbonara was so-so.  It was not a good as other places we had been too.  We couldn't pick out the reason but only knew so by the taste.

Roberto (?) was rude and not very attentive to us.  When he first came over to take our drink orders, everything seemed fine.  After that, things changed for some reason.  The wait to take our orders was extremely long.  In fact, several tables around us, where people arrived after us, had already ordered.  We tried to get his attention several times to no avail.  The menus were closed so that should have been a clue to him to come over.  It took several requests to just get the balsamic vinegar for our bread.  Then, after only having it for a few minutes, he came by and took the vinegar and olive oil, only to give it to a couple at an adjacent table.  Needless to say, both parties were shocked at that move.  The couple was kind enough to give them back to us after they had poured some for themselves.  

We might come back some time, as long as we do not have him again...

317,Rachel K.,"Let me tell you something. The NERVE of these sub par rude servers is BEYOND my comprehension. I can't even begin to express my rage because there are no words. We came here with family for a night out and all put in when the bill came. The server- who had to be asked to refill my glass and was nowhere to be seen most of the evening- decided that he is deserving of a 5 star tip and came BACK TO THE TABLE to ask ""if service was ok"" because he only go x amount of dollars. FIRST OF ALL how DARE you come to whole table and try to shame us. You can politely pull someone aside if you really think that there was an ""issue"". What in the flip is this?!? WHO DOES THAT!!!!! Who!!!!!!?!?? I've read some other reviews with the same issue and it seems like the manager ""addresses"" the problem but it continues to happen- so maybe GET RID OF YOUR SERVERS!!!!! I plan on showing back up and asking for a FULL REFUND. who the hell do they think they are? The food was sub par at best- and when you add that level of service then this hole should just go out of business. I've been to several upscale restaurants - this isn't one of them. And maybe they didn't get the memo but a tip is EARNED, if it isn't then just add it to my bill and don't leave me to decide what I want to give. This experience ruined the rest of our night and put a sour taste in our mouth for the rest of the trip. Glad this restaurant strives to embarrass their patrons and nothing is done about it. This isn't the last they've heard from me I'll tell you that.

318,Lori M.,"My daughter was visiting San Francisco with her boyfriend, so I wanted to send them a gift card for her favorite restaurant, Mona Lisa. Unfortunately as they went to use it, their waiter/waitress informed them it had to be printed. It does not state this on the site when you go to purchase. They're supposed to have a Merchant App, but they do not. This seemed like an easy way to buy them dinner, but that was a fail. I looked at the site who sells the cards and it says the retailer just scans it. Very disappointing, especially since we don't even live there anymore. Am I out the money? Beware-DO NOT buy online Gift Cards for this restaurant! Waiting on my refund from Egiftify. Will update my review once this has been resolved.

UPDATE:

I contacted Egiftify land after they communicated with Mona Lisa and myself, I have been refunded. I personally received a phone call from the manager at Mona Lisa and they apologized. I'm sure after educating their wait staff, there will no longer be issues with redeeming E-gifts.

The owner quickly came up to us and was super sweet so we decided to give this place a try! The decor was homey and very inviting with picture frames and busts everywhere. We decided to try the penne salsa rosa and lasagna vegetale. Overall the food was just okay. The penne pasta barely had any sauce and lacked taste. The lasagna lacked taste as well except for the spinach taste. I just wish it had more of a ricotta flavor I was looking for.
Other than that, the service was amazing as the server was attentive and very nice. The owner gave us a free appetizer of bruschetta which wasn't bad at all. 

I don't know if I would come back but the only reason I would come back would be for the decor and the amazing people who run the place!

325,Alex O.,"We here looking for good food with high expectations, while the food was great the service totally ruined the experience.

We were seated immediately into the small and busy restaurant and proceeded to wait 15 minutes before even being noticed to receive water, bread or a greeting. We flagged another waitress for some service, and while she helped us, our waiter was still nowhere to be found. 

Finally our waiter came to our table and without a greeting, asked in a very unfriendly way what we wanted to eat. 45 minutes later we received our food and our waiter never came back. 

All in all, a dinner that should have lasted an hour or so lasted nearly 2 due to the negligence of our waiter, and what a shame because the food was great. (Chicken Parm-- Penne Ala Vodka) 

If you're okay with going to a very busy place and waiting a long time for food and service, the food may be worth it to you, but for us, we won't be coming back.

334,Juanita I.,"After being lured in by the friendly owner while we were perusing the menu on the sidewalk late one Friday night our experience quickly went downhill. 

We were seated at the teeniest table next to the kitchen, right where the servers rounded the corner. They kept bumping my husbands chair and apologizing.

I don't know if not ordering drinks or appetizers affected our service in any way but it was subpar at best. We had had a very late lunch and weren't ravenously hungry. 

We got some crusty bread to munch on as we preceded to wait forever on our food. Our table was also missing the balsamic vinegar that was on other tables and our server never came around so we could ask for it.

After waiting a good hour plus on our food it finally arrived. 

My husband ordered Spaghetti Carbonara and while good it just can't top the decadence of the one we had years ago in Rome.

I had been craving a Margarita Pizza so that was what I had ordered and it was delicious!

During our time waiting we had plenty of chances to observe those around us and it was quite interesting! The table next to us got the five star treatment as the gentleman knew the owner. Their complimentary three tiered hor dourve tray looked heavenly! The strangest part was when the lady disappeared into the bathroom and a couple of minutes later the gentleman slipped in too. Oh dear! Only for both of them to emerge minutes later. 

So, to recap. The food was good but the service lackluster. I'd skip the Mona Lisa.

Pros: food was good, staff were friendly and fluent in Italian (with accents), food was good, atmosphere and decor were fantastic

Cons: service was excruciatingly slow (we were expecting this based on other reviews and it still exceeded our expectations!! We were there at 2 pm and there were only 4 other tables occupied). The only service I've ever had that was slower than this was in Italy - no joke - so maybe it's slow on purpose (which is why I gave them 4 stars. With American speeds it would be 5 and if I thought it wasn't slow on purpose then it would be 3 stars).

From a decor standpoint, ML subscribes to the theory that more is more.  Very old school, chintzy, Italian restaurant, to the point that it was actually fun.

The food came out fairly quickly, but the waiter was very inattentive.  In fact, he replaced my wife's Diet Coke because we advised him that the glass was chipped, but he didn't bother to refill my soda, even though the Glass was empty. 

The Gnocchi al Quattro Formaggi was way too heavy and the cheese was overpowering.  The spaghetti al'Amatrciana was pretty good. 

Overall, it was OK, but with so many other options in North Beach, don't think we'll be back.

We sat outside on the sidewalk tables. I don't recommend that we literally had people asking us questions while trying to eat and people smoking not recommended. But the reason for the one star is the service it wasn't busy and yet we waited a long time for everything and last but not least the server Antonio came over to argue about how much we tipped him when told that the service wasn't the best he said we where going to have bad karma!

2)  My daughter was in heaven!  She LOVED the pesto sauce we hot with our mini fried calzone appetizer.  Not a lick of sauce left as she dredged up every spec with bread.  I tried to make the same sauce when we got home, but fell short despite my intentions!
3) Everything looked good and we had a hard time deciding what we wanted.  So, we found 3 items and agreed to share so we could all get a taste.  My daughter's friend got the 4 cheese alfredo (OMG yum!!!), my daughter got the canniloni and I got the lasagna (both came in a large hot dish still bubbling from the oven).  Everyone was so happy!

My friends ordered a calzone and I ordered the Fettuccine Leonardo. It is basically chicken and Alfredo sauce with baby tomatoes. Extremely good and has lots of flavor. So, if you're ever in walking home from Pier 39, you might find this place. It's fantastic!

371,Long T.,"We were in our second night at San Francisco and decided on Italian to celebrate our time during the New Year holiday.  My brother found this restaurant and it was quite delicious.  Atmosphere was really nice and we got to hang out and have fun without causing a fuss around other people.

I ordered an Italian steak with a melted Gorgonzola Cheese topping, but definitely wanted my Fettuccine Alfredo pasta fix.  Food was really exceptional and loved every bite!

Only thing I did not really care for was our very minimum effort server.  He was big and was okay enough, but spent more time with other tables than ours.  I was quite disappointed with that.

If you want to come for the Italian food, that's cool.  It's best enjoyed sitting down (though the wait time was pretty long too).  Just don't expect THAT stellar of a service when compared to other restaurants around the area.

372,Moe D.,"Make sure your waiter speaks English. They don't listen when you say easy ice on your soda and instead I got a drink with more ice without realizing it. Then the waiter tried to charge me for a refill because my soda was finished before food arrived. When I asked to remove it the waiter asked me why I only have 10% tip and that he is new and all that other bs so I gave 20% to shut him up. He also forgot to give me my to go food because he was busy ringing up his tip. If you don't do your job right then you don't deserve a tip at all. Moral of this is make sure you get a waiter that speaks good english.

When I say the food was delicious, my husband said it's the closest to his grandmothers lasagna has ever had... our baby was even eating the meat sauce like he couldn't get enough.

The owner was around the whole time and truly provided old school customer service. This will be a new staple for us every time we visit. It's no surprise they've been in business for 39 years!

375,Narine G.,"Came to visit Little Italy and Chinatown today with family to take in the atmosphere and different cultures. My review is as follows: 
For the food: 5/5
For the service: 3/5
For the atmosphere 3.5/5
Overall: 4/5.

As a starter, there is bread with balsamic vinaigrette and olive oil. For the table of four, we had ordered the appetizer platter (for two), which was plenty for a party of four. We were all thoroughly impressed with the calamari (especially the sauce), along with the salami, and cheese. For my personal entree, I ordered the lobster ravioli. Though the entree was not plenty in portion it was plenty in heartiness. Everyone else on the table ordered the fettuccini pescatoro (and were equally pleased, minus the misratio in clams/mussels to pasta). Overall, I would recommend getting the appetizer platter with a bottle of wine, for an afternoon delight.

For the service - our waiter did not seem too interested in assisting us. On a busy night, I would have understood . . . Also, I felt that as we were the only young adults, we were frowned upon.

There are a lot of choices in this part of town and I'm glad we decided to eat here.  We order fettuccini Alfredo, chicken parm and a pizza which I don't remember what it was called.  Everything was fresh it did take a while to get our food but since it's all made to order it was well worth the wait.   I would have taken pics of our food but eveyone was so hungry that I didn't get a chance to.  If and when I come back to frisco I will defiantly come back here to eat again

389,Sonia D.,"My parents / brother were visiting me in the city, which happens rarely, and I wanted to take them to a nice restaurant in North Beach. However, I am so extremely disappointed with staff, service, and food that it ruined the whole night. Let me address each piece...

1. Service- we were seated quickly, but once seated we waited for forever before someone even came to our table.  It took so long that we almost left, but finally our server came after more than 20 minutes and brought us water. Which brings me to point 2....

2. Staff- HORRIBLE. We were greeted by Luca, and by the time were ready to order since they took so long to arrive in the first place. Let me start off by saying he was not at all pleasant. We weren't all that hungry, so we ordered 3 dishes to share: Chicken Piccata, Rigatoni Aldon Smith, and Risotto. Luca immediately arrogantly stated that since there are four of us dining, we would have to order four dishes.

What?! This was nowhere stated on the menu, and I saw other diners at the restaurant clearly sharing dishes. I thought he was joking at first and tried to laugh it off, but he retorted that he was being serious and demanded us to order another dish. I asked for some time to think about what we wanted to order. I was shocked that there was an obligation to order one dish per person for our table, when clearly it wasn't a requirement for others. I realized a few minutes later that he was probably taking advantage of us, thinking that we are tourists, since we were there as a family? I flagged him down and asked him to cancel our order and we will take our business elsewhere, and suddenly he seemed okay with serving us. This was absolutely not the ambiance I wanted to bring my family to, and was so upset at the upfront rude behavior of Luca that it ruined the rest of my night. 

3. The food itself was hit or miss. Rigatoni was excellent, Risotto was average, and the Chicken tasted like it was just boiled and doused in sauce. 

The food and service could have been pardoned, but I am so turned off by the arrogant behavior of the staff that I am never returning here again.

390,Yowz A.,"I live here. I've been to every restaurant on Columbus more than once.

This is by far the worst. Not even close. I had pasta with pancetta, but they must have heard my order as ""pasta with rancid pancetta."" The only thing worse than the taste was the after-taste.

My dining partner ordered pasta with cheese sauce. They served her naked pasta and started shredding parmesan cheese on it. We said, no, we want cheese sauce. They said, ""We don't have cheese sauce. We have four-cheese sauce."" So we asked, to their visible annoyance, to send it back and come back with ""four-cheese sauce.""

The salad was overflowing with oily dressing, making it inedible.

The draft beer provided ummistakeable evidence that they never clean their beer lines.

This place is beyond awful. What an embarrassment to North Beach.

This review is long over due.

My boyfriend made a reservation here on Valentine's Day at 5:00. We got here at 5:07 (finding parking) and ordered around 10 minutes later. We ordered the calamari appetizer - they give you a lot, but there were no tentacles! The redeeming part of this dish was the marinara. 

The real juicer was the wait time for our main dishes. Ree. Dick. Q. Lus. 

We waited a good 45 minutes for very plain pasta. Service was atrocious and seemed annoyed at us asking to check on our order.

The pasta that we got was very basic and probably could easily be concocted by getting tortellini at Trader Joe's or Costco. Not worth the money or hassle.

Cons:
1. Longgggggggg time to get food!
2. Food was mediocre
3. Service was below par
4. Expensive for food quality that is below Maggiano's!

Bottom line? Will not return. Ever.

397,Rachel M.,"Came here because a former coworker of mine said this restaurant is really romantic. We were seated right away, and we thought we were off to a good start.

Well, long-story short, the ambiance was probably the only great thing about this place. They weren't busy when we went here at 8PM, but our waiter paid more attention to their other guests than us, so we felt very neglected. Maybe we just came on a bad day. 

For all these reviews about amazing food and a long wait for the food, we expected the food to be incredible. We did wait a while for our food, but that's not problematic for us. We were just really disappointed by how the food tasted. I am a huge advocate of chicken parmigiana, and it lacked flavor. This was my boyfriend's first time trying it, and now he's not convinced he should try other chicken parmigiana for comparison. 

The ravioli we got was ok tasting, and so was their bruschetta and tiramisu. For the price we paid for the food, though, it doesn't connect with us.

The owner is there often and chats with the customers. He and many of the workers are from Italy and have great stories if you take the time to talk to them. The food is amazing and very hearty and authentic. I'm pretty sure they make their gnocci in house, as well as their sauces. The red marinara sauce is so flavorful and pairs well with many of their dishes. Great wine selections as well.

Food:
We could smell how great everything was even before we walked in. It made waiting for our food that much harder, but, luckily, our food came out fairly quickly. The appetizer platter was MASSIVE. We got two and they were served on what looked like tiered tea trays. Very pretty, presentation wise. I personally loved all the vegetarian dishes, and everyone seemed to enjoy the rest of the appetizers.

410,Reba Jane S.,"With our latest Restaurant.com coupon in hand, we eagerly zipped across the Bay Bridge and into Little Italy.  It was a crisp evening, so the warmth of Mona Lisa was very much welcomed by my husband and me.  
We were greeted outside, ushered in and shown to our table just that quick.  
Fresh bread, bottles of water and a menu.  We're on our way.  But first, we had to try the bread.  A little olive oil, a little balsamic vinegar and uummmmm.  Delicious.  But we didn't want to fill up on bread.  How we managed any self control is beyond me.  Bread is a weak point with us.
So we ordered an appetizer, the mini calzones with pesto.  The calzones were stuffed with cheese and ham.  Fried (baked?) to perfection and the pesto was so creamy and a great dipping sauce.  It came on a lettuce bed that was dressed with some fresh tomatoes.  This would be a perfect lunch all by itself for the hungry business person.  And, the tomato, calzone and pesto combo was a real taste treat, said my husband!
Our entree' (I've shamefully forgotten the name of the dish) was a chicken breast that was grilled and seasoned with some special peppers.  On the side were roasted potatoes and also a side of spinach.  A little of everything on the fork for the perfect bite.  
Aside from the perfectly delicious food, the atmosphere is just plain fun.  All sorts of things going on, yet not in your face.  Look around.  Famous people's pictures who've visited are framed on the walls around the place.  The ceiling is a light show!  The music, I wish it were Italian as well.  Just a personal thing.  I like hearing the music of the place that the food is paying homage to.
Our server was gracious.  Service was excellent.  I'm so glad we had the opportunity to visit Mona Lisa.  This is now on our ""Revisit"" list.  I'm not a big fan of Italian food.  It seems to be mostly of three components: meat, pasta, sauce.  Boring.  I have been awaken to Good Italian Food!  And you can be too!

417,Alex R.,"I now understand the 3.5 star review for this restaurant. I am thankful that they drop off a bread basket as soon as you sit down. This was able to hold us over for an hour and a half until we received our plate of spaghetti and a plate fettuccini alfredo. That's right, an hour and a half wait for our dinner, and that's not including the 30-40 minutes it took for the waiter to come and take out order. Oh and if you think you're getting a refill during that hour and a half, it's not going to happen. So be sure to ration out your beverage. 

By looking around, I could easily tell that I was not the only one unpleased with the wait. I even observed two customers send their orders back because they were not prepared correctly. The staff appears to be untrained and is unable to handle the busy Saturday rush. At no time did anyone apologize for he wait, or keep us updated on our meals preparation process. One thing that really got to me, was when a table that ordered after us, received their meals about 10-15 minutes before us. Again, I did not have a complicated order, but definitely waited as if I did.

We shared a plate with bruschetta, complex with herb marinade and fresh, with some mozzarella, basil, and toasted French bread.
My Vitello Mona Lisa was outstanding.  A Marsala sauce that was both sweet from the Marsala wine and savory from the mushrooms was served with excellent wilted spinach and roasted potatoes that had a perfect outer crunch.  The Prosciutto on top was crispy and delicious.
He had his standby favorite that he orders wherever we go, the Veal Parmigiana.  The sauce was bright and slightly sweet, certainly made with pomodora.

We had a large group (14) who couldn't agree on where to eat. Thankfully my fiancés cousin wanted to dine at Mona Lisa because one of his buddies who knows the owner highly recommended it. Loving Italian food I went along with it and as did everyone else.

We were greeted and seated promptly. Our server was extremely attentive and guided us thru the menu. We were served delicious complimentary appetizers. Such a nice gesture from the owner. My food was to die for. LOVE LOVE LOVE the amazing sauce they use for the Lobster Ravioli. My food was excellent and I was extremely satisfied. Didn't feel bloated afterwards, it was light, yet fulfilling. Everyone was content with their selections as the portions. 

It's difficult to dine with such a big group and satisfy everyone, they nailed it! 

Afterwards we took pictures with the Mona Lisa vehicle - such a touristy thing to do but we LOVED it. Will definitely return and try more items.

424,Shelby D.,"The one rating is not for the food at this place. When visiting this restaurant yesterday, the food was hands down thee best Italian food that I have ever tasted. 
The one star is for our server. Being in the industry for 8 years, the following was very disappointing. We ordered a soup, salad and calamari to start. Happily pacing ourselves with the appetizers while preparing for our entrees. There were 2 wine glasses that were empty on our table for more than 10 minutes. When they wanted another glass, we could not spot our server anywhere in site and had to flag down another wait staff to try to find our server. We asked how much longer for our food, to which he responded that he was waiting for the Caesar salad to be finished that we had on the table. Well my oh my, this was no small Caesar salad to start with. Shocked to say the least to hear from our server that they were trained to wait until all the food was completely gone until firing up the entrees. 
When clearing the appetizers off the table, there was no pardon my reach while our server felt inches away from my face with his arm extending to grab the soup bowl. This happened more than once, sadly. 
Our entrees arrived at last and everything was cooked to perfection. Zero complaints about plates, presentation, temperature, or anything else guests tend to comment on. 
We ordered two desserts which were pretty delicious. 
Our server only checked on us twice while there was food on the table, while one of the check ins was if we wanted boxes. 
To say if we'll be back for another shot...not too sure on that one.

427,Peanuts M.,"The food here is not good! It's frozen food heated up in the microwave. There's nothing original or tasty. The chicken was rubbery, the raviolis were microwaved and overall, not very appealing to my taste buds. The pizza was the only thing that was ok.

The service however-excellent. Everyone was super friendly and accommodating.  They were very warm and welcoming people-thank you!

429,Jim G.,"Very rarely will I give anything lower than 3 stars unless I was completely dissatisfied with the whole experience. Aside from the lovely hostess with curly hair and glasses ( didn't catch your name, but keep up the wonderful job) my experience here may be my last. 

- It's a disgusting feeling when you do not feel welcomed to a restaurant or anywhere for that matter. I ate here with my younger brother and felt that our waiter prioritized certain tables over ours. Haven been a waiter, I understand different signs customers give me in order to accommodate their wants and needs. That being said, we closed our menus since we already decided on what to get. Our waiter passed us several times and clearly saw that we were ready, but still insisted on not acknowledging us. Finally, he took our orders. Losing my appetite already, but hey, hopefully the food compensates for his lack of friendly service.

- Food comes out and it looks semi-pleasing. My ""Spaghetti Polpette "" lacked sauce. The spaghetti itself was not cooked al dente as requested. My brother's pasta, ""Spaghetti allo Scoglio"" was appetizing, I give them that. 

- I took a couple bites and was not pleased, so I was waiting for my waiter to check up on us. He went to our table and asked us how the food was (kind gesture) but as I was speaking, he walks away to attend to another table, that did not even flag him down. Such a rude move. He comes back after attending to the table next to mine, and says, "" you wanted more sauce?"" ""Yes, please"".

- I was presented with more sauce in a timely manner. Sauce wasn't flavorful, but I really didn't want to be that ""one guy"" so decided to let it go. Did not end up packing our leftovers (which I usually do). 

It could have been an off day for them. Our waiter could have been having a bad day. But regardless of the fact, servitude, friendliness, and tastiness is always key, and Mona Lisa did not reach my expectations. Would I give this place another try? Yeah, I would, but would definitely try something else and request another server.

431,Ittai B.,"I just had dinner here last night for my girlfriend's birthday. And it was amazing.

North Beach has its fair share of Italian food, so it's meaningful when a restaurant is able to stand out among so much competition. I'll break it down.

The Food - I need to start here. The bread is classic Italian - slightly crispy outside and soft inside. We split the caprese for an appetizer - everything was fresh and crisp. I ordered the Mix Seafood Grill - a massive helping of shrimp, swordfish, and some of the best salmon I've had in years. My girlfriend had the chicken cacciatore, which we both loved. For dessert, the tiramisu was simply divine.

The Service - When I say ""everyone was fantastic"", I mean *everyone*. The owner himself was making sure we had the experience we wanted.

The Ambiance - there is a classic fiat out front that they've converted into a little booth for two. We had dinner while watching the setting sun change the sky's colors. 

It couldn't have been better. And my Italian girlfriend agreed.

434,Kt K.,"Our first choice ran out of pizza so we meandered over to Mona Lisa's and looked at the menu and  the fellow who drives the tiny fiat said I have a table for you come in, I will take care of you .... I believe he meant it , I am of the Italian linage and I know Italians love to nurture people will food ...He had me at hello.....

the place is buzzing with activity and the staff is hustling all over . The ambiance it sexy with some  quirky over tones which are to be pursued while you wait for your probably too busy to actually give you service waiter ....which made this a food experience , not a dining experience ..DO NOT expect to have a leisurely romantic meal here , you will be genuinely disappointed . Plus , the lighting is dim so everyone looks pretty ....the tables are small so ordering a variety of items will not be a comfortable endeavor , and since they pack them in ...expect to be crowded and rushed . 

The glass are probably sterile , but the cleaning lady has been here is a decade or so ...get over it if you want to enjoy - marred wine glasses with finger print and servers tossing giant chilled bottles of water under their arms in bulk to toss them on your table without making any eye contact what so ever .....

Being ignored by our server in the beginning was a bit off putting but we stuck it out ..he didn't recommend anything on the menu .... if he did say the Margerite's pizza was boring and I appreciated the honesty ...it was also only $12 buck and I wondered if he was like yeah move up the price point .....so I threw him raise a ordered a glass of wine - it was tolerable but I won't rave about it any memoir - this is not a wine list type of place ...if you want great wine here you should bring and pay any corkage fee with glee - your palate will thank you . 

We ordered and appetizer and I think our waiter not interested with that -- it was a very put the butts in the seats and get them out vibe . 

But the burrata came and it was lovely - the prosciutto  was delicious with a fantastic texture and intricate flavor ... and burrata was lovely right temp the dish a delight - the bread however was unfortunate ....Stale dry San Fransisco sour dough only resealed  by the delicious olive oil that boasted a true olive flavor and added that fat the the bread needed - they really should call ACME and figure out the bread but they are busy so don't really have to fix it ......

My happy level came up after the burrata ....and then the food came - meatballs as perfect as meatballs can me finding the delicate line between flavorful robust meat and tender juicy fall apart on your fork goodness -- someone grandmother taught them well ...I had the parpadelli with bolognese and the pasta was delightful light and smooth and absorbent of the sauce which was good but not a cream finished deeply robust meat sauce - but good ....the Lasagna was a muilti  layered  yum fest really highlighting the good parmesan and increasingly pasta ..... yummy --

At glance summary - nice enough - food is tasty - service is uninterested in you and assume you are a tourist and if you no like a tourist on the street will happily take your place - understand you are eating and moving on  enjoy !

Customer service wasn't great the waiter seemed to only help us when we kept bugging for his attention, we decided to not leave a tip because we weren't satisfied with the service. while paying we stated that we weren't leaving a tip, on our way out the waiter asked if we were leaving a tip we stated that we weren't and he then started rambling about how were we not going to pay them, that he needed money to pay the cooks as if they aren't already getting paid already, he insisted that we left a tip but no where did it say it was mandatory after basically arguing with him we decided to just leave and ignore his comments.

436,Elisabeth P.,"We searched areas in northbeach that had gluten free pasta options and this came up really close to our hotel. We were able to make reservations online and had no problems getting seated right away. Our order was taken quickly and food came out promptly. Our server was nice and helped with my gf requests. 

The atmosphere is like so many other cute cozy Italian restaurants in the little Italy district. Tons of little tables packed together, Italian flags hanging from the walls, the ceilings painted with resembles to the Sistine chapel and similar romantic art. 

The gluten free options here are good. They have a rice fusilli pasta and said I could have any sauce... And wow did they have a lot of sauces. Almost too many to choose from. They also have gf pizzas. 

We ordered the caprese salad which was good and they also made a tomato based calamari appetizer since I couldn't have the fritti, it was pretty good. I had the bolgonese meat sauce which was tasty, tho my pasta was really undercooked and tough to eat. My friends ordered a veal dish and the other a risotto with prawns. The one with the veal said it wasn't bad and the one with the risotto didn't eat much of hers. 

Price was ok. About 16 for the pasta and 11 or so for the appetizer was what I paid for. It was really nice that there wasn't any additional gluten free charge, that is hard to find. I ordered their house Cabernet which was good, I just thought 10.00 was a little pricey for just a house glass of wine.. But then again, maybe I've just been in the Midwest too long

Overall it wasn't bad. I would go there again but it wouldn't be my first choice in northbeach.

438,Molly A.,"This restaurant was the best Italian restaurant I've been too and that's saying a lot. It had this vibe you know, it was crowded but in a good way. It was covered wall to wall with paintings. There were really 2 main points about this restaurant that really stood out to me. First off the food was to die for. We got the tower off appetizers plus we had the bread they gave us to start off with. We were so full by the time it got to our main course! All of this shocked me cause usually I can eat ALOT. But this is all in a good way, we wanted to eat all the food. When it did get to our main course we ate maybe 3-5 bites plus bite from others people to try theirs. The food was excellent and tasted very good the next day! Lastly but certainly not least, THE SERVICE! The service was tremendous here they were so kind. So first when we walked in there was this kind man greeting everyone and talking to everybody. Then this amazing lady got you situated and talked to you as well. She made sure you were ready to eat and hoped you were having a good day. They good came out relatively quick and did not disappoint. They did a good job checking on us making sure everything was just right. Once we are our main course they do something I've never seen, ever. They asked how our food was and then we asked for to go boxes. Then they got them for us and then he proceeded to put our food in the boxes for all of us and put them in a bag for us to take to our hotel. I've never seen that before but it just seemed so nice. Then we got our check payed and got up and left. The same person that greeted us said goodbye. Really I would recommend and would go here again!

My main course was the gnocchi and 4 cheese sauce. It was like little pillows of scrumptiousness! My son had the spaghetti vongele, and it had clams cooked perfectly with lots of yummy garlic. My husband's cannolini was baked and bubbling when it arrived at the table and every last morsel was devoured! We were so stuffed we had no room for dessert, but it looked like we missed out!

I've been coming here since I was a kid, Maurizio has always stood at the door to welcome passer-bys and returning patrons. As I walk in, I'm always greeted with a kiss on both cheeks and a glass of wine. And on a few occasions I've even been seated in the Fiat outside. 

Funny story - I went on a first date to Mona Lisa, this guy was going on and on about how great the food and atmosphere are. He had no idea I was a regular. We walked in, and Maurizio greeted my with a kiss on the cheek and sat me down at my favorite spot in the corner. My date could tell something was up. After a few minutes, this guy was so confused when an order of Calamari was delivered to the table, ""Courtesy of the Owner."" I laughed and told him that Mona Lisa is like a second home to me. Dinner was outstanding, as always. I had Ravioli with Vodka sauce (my favorite) and he had the Pollo Piccata (my second favorite.) We shared a bottle of Pinot Grigio and tiramisu for dessert. Unfortunately, we didn't fall in love... but the food was great, so thats a plus!

468,Alina D.,"I genuinely had a wonderful experience here and have no complaints whatsoever. It's a genuine Italian restaurant - sure, it plays up stereotypes to draw people in (i mean, it's named Mona Lisa and has a fiat), but the experience overall was fantastic. Just don't be in a rush. The staff (as far as I could tell) and the owners are Italian to the core, so things may not be prompt or quick, but they will be good and delicious. 

My family and I were drawn in by the owner standing outside next to the menu, and while we were looking at it he mentioned that an appetizer was free for the July 4th weekend, and that we could trust his cooking since he was Italian, Etc etc, and for curiosity's sake we were like: sure ok. We were seated immediately, near the windows, so the dim lighting wasn't so bad, but I can imagine further into the restaurant it would be more difficult to take photos of your meal. The inside itself is beautifully decorated with a painted ceiling and fun pictures and statues. Throughout my time there, the waiters were singing along to the Italian songs and chatting amongst themselves casually, and I thought it was just really amusing and different than say, an Olive Garden or any other run-of-the-mill Italian place. 

The free appetizer we did get was a delightful crostini that we ate with our red wine we ordered - I believe we got the Cabernet our waiter recommended. The sliced bread we received as we waited for our food was also refilled promptly and delicious as well. It seemed as if there were not enough olive oil/balsamic containers to go around but our waiter took ours from an empty table so it didn't cause a bother. The place was busy and popping by the time we left, and it was pretty funny because there was an older fellow outside who must be a friend of the owners or maybe work for the restaurant who was greeting people and saying 'thanks for coming' etc, and he had a picture with the owners on one of the walls, so at first we thought he must be famous but we had no idea. Just a treat to people watch!

And, ok, the meal. I will dream of this meal I think, forever. I'm going to Rome for a few months next year but I don't even know if anything there can top it. The menu had so many unique choices it was so hard to choose, but eventually I settled on the gnocchi with Gorgonzola sauce, spinach, and pecans. 

It was mind blowing. The sauce was creamy and so thick so I had to stop several times just to savor it, but I'm so glad I had the wine and the time. I didn't even end up finishing it all! My table also ordered an eggplant dish, a veal dish, and another pasta dish, and they were all delicious as well (I of course sampled - how could I not?) Anyway. It was absolutely fantastic, hands down the best Italian food I've had in America. 


Tldr: go. Order bravely. Take your time. Enjoy it.

The ambience was romantic, the service attentive, and the manager was awesome.  He provided us with a free cheese veggie charcuterie meat appetizer plate which was a nice touch.  They also brought out the TASTIEST CREAMIEST TIRAMISU free for my birthday.  While free is great, as we are also business owners, we always support other business owners so I made sure and was happy to include extra tip to pay for the free appetizer and free desert.  Free aside, this place is fab for ambience, great service, great food, value; and kudos to the mgr for his leadership of the crew and overall friendliness.  He's pictured on the business card.

I have been on the search for the best calamari for a couple of years now and I think I finally found it.  The place was packed but service was quick.  Will go back next time I'm in the City!

482,Cecilia L.,"The reason for my one star is due to my waiter who we asked to split the with specific details and guess what, he did as he pleased.

Then came back and said, "" it's going to take a long time to fix"". I don't care JULIAN it's your job!!!
HE DIDN'T FIX IT BECAUSE IT WAS GOING TO TAKE TOO LONG. So I guess this restaurant doesn't have respect for your money. I have never been so upset at a restaurant before.

To the manager, I would consider training your servers on how to refund because he pretty much told me my money doesn't matter.

483,Max F.,"This is not bad Italian cousin restaurant but today when I went here with my wife I got the most terrible service ever from servers in my life. This guys were like a stupid asshole. They were every time late and confused with my orders: they brought another pizza, they forgot about beer, when I asked about 2 dishes they brought 1, and portion of panzerotti was smallest than usual - 3 instead of 4. Also when I asked to call manager server Roberto said he just left, also this Roberto was absolutely not friendly, rude and said he would call police cause we didn't want to pay for beer we didn't order. And at the end he even allowed himself to swear!! Is it what you called ""great"" service?! 
Will never come back here! And don't recommend.

484,Roger N.,"Convenient after Beach Blanket Babylon, the food was solid, if unspectacular.  They sat us near the front door, which never closed, and we were chilly the entire meal.  Might have ranked it 4-star but for that.  Service was so-so, friendly, but we had to ask twice for olive oil. Very Italian atmosphere, which would have been more enjoyable if we weren't cold.

I had chicken parmigiana, which was good, just not as good as what my wife makes.  Roasted potato and spinach sides were excellent.  My son's pepperoni pizza had a really good crust and was cooked well, but it had a bit too much sauce for his preference.  We also tried the tortellini formaggio (very cheesy) and spaghetti carbonara (pancetta could have been crisper), which both had good flavor.

485,Kirby O.,"1 large party
Reservation time: 7:30
Seated: 8:10
Entrees arrived: 9:15 or so

Service was bafflingly slow, even by Italian standards. It took at least 15 minutes for the server to greet us after we had been seated. We watched many other parties be seated and served, meanwhile we had to flag down our server to get wine and bread while we waited. My out of town guests enjoyed their entrees, but my bf and I thought our pastas were mediocre at best. I can think of lots of local Italian places with better food and service at a better (or similar) price point.

Edit: I appreciate the restaurant's response. Perhaps we would have enjoyed the pasta more if it was served at the right temperature. Sure, it was busy that night, but the slow service kept us from enjoying our dinner and I won't be back.

My husband enjoyed his Diavola Pizza, I had a slice and it was great. My Cioppino was OK..I've had better but the portion was huge. Prices are spot on for Little Italy, our disappointing lunch at the wharf cost more. Yeah, we should've know better but were playing tourist for the day.

The food was ok but our waiter was as friendly as an overcooked Italian sausage. Like we were an inconvenience to him. ZERO eye contact, ZERO warmth, basically a big fat ZERO when it came to service.

495,Johnny L.,"Thee Best Italian I have ever had!  Little Italy in San Fran is a must when ur roaming around CT (Chinatown)

so the 1st time we came here, we heard thru a recommendation from a spice place nearby, as we were trying 2 find the best Italian restaurant 2 go 2 n thanks 2 him.. we found this place!  thank u thank u!

that 1st time we went, I had the salmon risotto in cream sauce; it was like HEAVEN!  man, y don't we have this in Seattle?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! yeah, it was that serious.. my wife had a gnocchi dish n she fell absolutely in love!!!

the day after our 1st visit, we went back n shared a pizza, I believe it was Calabrese which had oregano, sausage w/ full flavors of tomato n garlic, we may have added prosciutto.. it was really good!

everything is good

so many items 4 each form of pasta, just countless good stuff! on their menu

this 3rd time we went, we went 4 lunch n we shared a Calzone al Forno; it was the best calzone I had in my whole life.. definitely different from the American calzone, as it was softer like a pastry crust filled w/ fresh Italian tomato sauce that teamed up w/ fresh mozzarella 2 soak in2 the stuffed prosciutto that gave the eater something that will eject them out of their seat n out of this world because it was so good.. the only complaint will b if the inside was hot, since it was sitting @ the chef's counter 4 a little bit n cooled off

the service is consistently good

this place has a lot of photos of famous ppl who came here such as any1 from Derek Jeter 2 Martin Yan.. it is just that good since 1979! n the decor I bet has looked the same since then

just the Best Italian, @ least on the West Coast.. that I can say

496,Veronica M.,"Being a North Beach girl for the last 20 plus years, I know where to go & what to go for.  The usual Italian restaurant for us in the neighborhood has long been Sodini's or Ideale.  Mona Lisa has always been considered a tourist spot.  But out w friends recently, the wait for Sodini's was 45 minutes, so we decided to give Mona Lisa's a try.  

Stick w certain pasta dishes & you'll be fine.  My man's chicken piccata was a true study in mediocrity.  It was over salted & the sauce was a clingy mess instead of accentuating & tasty.  Pass.

The carbonara, on the other hand, was delicious.  The bacon was extra crispy, which gave great contrast to the dish.  The sauce was rich & flavorful.  A decadent dish.  Lip smacking good.

The rigatoni w truffle I ordered was also very good.  Good balance of flavor, w just the right amount of truffle, this dish was lighter & cleaner than the carbonara.  My man kept taking bites.  He didn't care for his piccata dish, but really liked this.  And it was nicely al dente.  A win.

It's kitschy, but not completely over the top.  This is North Beach.

In a pasta mood?  Mona Lisa's not a bad call.  Just know what to order.

499,Armand D.,"BAD. RUDE. INSULTING. WOW!! I was INCREDIBLY offended by the service here, and I'm not easily offended. So much so that I NEVER, EVER leave Yelp reviews, but this prompted me to sign in after YEARS of city eating. To be honest, it really felt like prejudice (over I don't know WHAT, sure we looked young and funny looking but hell, I was wearing a tie even).
It was the worst service I've ever seen GLOBALLY. Here's a breakdown:
* We came in Saturday night, 2 hours before closing. Asked to sit outside, they said sure. 
* THEY IGNORED US! After water came, we NEVER saw them again. Over 20 minutes, and they were NOT busy at all, maybe 3 tables full inside. 
* We asked to move inside because we had waited so long we were FREEZING. They said sure, and we had to move our water and place settings in OURSELVES.
* Still: SLOW, RUDE service. Mainly a short haired/short bearded guy WHO WENT HOME and walked past us as we were sitting (wearing a black shirt and black backpack).
* WOW!!!!!! We asked for a little vinegar and olive oil for our bread, and they said ""Sorry guys, OUT OF VINEGAR"", which is fairly shocking for an ITALIAN RESTAURANT.
* WHAT?!?!?! After he left, another waiter came buy 10 minutes later and BROUGHT A BOTLE OF VINEGAR TO THE TABLE OF TWO WOMEN SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO US.
______INCREDIBLY INSULTING!!!!!!__________
* Had to ask for a refill of water, had to ask for the check (which took FOREVER), NEVER was checked on to see how everything was going. 
* The table next to us had to SEND AN ITEM BACK because IT WAS UNDERCOOKED. The waiter asked if they wanted a discount, they said ""No. We want what we ordered, but now we want it to go"". 
* Again, we arrived 2 HOURS before closing, so it's not that we walked in 10 minutes before closing, but even an hour into our meal a guy shouted ""WE CLOSED"" to a group trying to walk in. 

Hell! We were just a group of to, a young guy and a young lady. We just wanted to have a quick bite and we pay/tip well! But for the first time ever: I DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE A TIP, THEY DID NOT DESERVE A PENNY. I WAS COMPLETELY INSULTED AND IT FEELS LIKE WE WERE ""PRETTY WOMAN'D"" (aka judged for appearing to not have money). 

I left a $1 tip and I hope they got the insult. Congratulations Mona Lisa, I'm against leaving bad feedback but YOU PUSHED THE ENVELOPE. We will forever laugh at how terrible and rude your service was, and if I were the owner reading this, I would definitely take a look at that server who served us Saturday night 6/10/17. 

It's a shame, the food was good. But you could have given us C service and this would have been fine. You gave us not even F services, but I'm giving you and I- FOR INSULTING. 

Shame.

Why?
Service below average. Our cousin joined us after we had our food, and the server didn't give her a menu, water, and only barely acknowledged her presence (she ended up eating elsewhere). 
Food very expensive, and not very good. My meal was tasteless and bland. My husband didn't feel well after eating there. 
The decor and location are fine, it is cramped but that was OK. 
The topless Mona Lisa picture was interesting. 
I'd say, go there and just have wine, salad and bread and make up your mind before ordering anything else.

501,Yvette G.,"Normally I would only give this place four stars, but the service was so outstanding that I had to give it five stars.

Mauricio was awesome! My friends and I were promptly greeted when we arrived, and were seated immediately.  We shared an appetizer with caprese, bruschetta, and Sicilian candy.  The ""candy"" is candied garlic, and it's amazing.  I probably would have eaten the whole thing if I wasn't so afraid of knocking a persons' socks off when I spoke.

I had the linguine allo squallo (spelling?). It was an awesome pasta dish with salmon, mussels, calamari, and other seafood goodness that I can't remember. The red sauce was lightly seasoned and did not drench the pasta, which I like.   Mauricio suggested an amazing Greek (yes, Greek!) wine that was fruit forward with a nice dry after-taste.  The wine complimented the dinner perfectly. My friends and I also shared the pistacchio dessert and the tiramisu.  All of us were ready to take a nap after dinner!  My friends and I plan to be in North Beach again in a couple months and we will definitely be coming back to Mona Lisa : )

The Italian Sampler triple level offering is excellent as is the Iron Skillet Cioppino ( I would order this and they have a version with pasta and crusted Pizza topping to hold in the steaming broth).  They have handmade Ravoli - 5 different versions.  I did not love my Veal Saltimboca - no brown sauce, sage too chopped and Veal tough and tasteless.  Ambiance is fun and quirky - NY Italian meets Hollywood.

It was so fantastic.  They brought out a meat and cheese tray before the meal and it was totally worth it.  Be advised drinks are a little over priced and when I say drinks I mean coke and sprite.  But the food is worth every penny so I stuck with water because soda changes the flavor of the food.  My kiddo ordered the pizza too and she raved about it.  She's a really tough critic.  My other half ordered the lobster ravioli and he said is was to die for.  Worth every bite and he licked his plate clean, the sauce was yummy. Now I will be honest we were here about 3 months ago but I wanted to make sure that I got my update on here.  Can't wait to visit again.

504,Alfredo D.,"Asked for olive oil four times. The people sitting behind us and next to us got the olive oil after only the second time they asked. Made us wait 20mins even though we had a reservation. The bread came out cold and borderline stale. The calamari came recommended by the waiter and it was subpar at best. It was very chewy and oily. The sauce was great that came with it and paired nicely with our bread that was olive oil-less. Then the another table that was seated a bit after us and definitely ordered after us received their two entrees before us. We only ordered one to split. And then to round it off. The ravioli we ordered was minuscule in comparison to everything else. Not bad but not great. How is ravioli more expensive then a large order of calamari but yet so much smaller? Mine as well go to bucca di bepo and know what you're getting yourself into and get your money's worth.

It was just okay in my opinion - there was not too much flavor in the tomato sauce and I couldn't really taste any lobster.

519,Gerald R.,"NORTH BEACH EATING PART VIII: SOUTHERN CUISINE - COLUMBUS DAY

I ate here at lunch today on Columbus Day. As my title stated I generalized the cuisine as southern cuisine. When I have been starting my North Beach adventure I would go to Italian restaurants trying to find specialized, regional cuisines. One of the major problems of trying to categorize the regional cuisine of the restaurant is the extensive menu. There are so many items on the list I was worried about the quality of each dish. In addition I couldn't what in the menu what the regional cuisine of this restaurant; the only reason I stated southern cuisine of this restaurant was because it stated on the Yelp information. Having quick lunch I needed to just one item, but I wasn't sure what item to ordered. It was either Fettuccine Mona Lisa or a risotto dish. I asked the waiter his recommendation about the risotto. He asked if I liked meat or seafood. I was thinking about the seafood. He went down the list to pick certain items. In the end I decided to order the Fettuccine Mona Lisa for one reason. In the past if a certain restaurant names a dish after its own restaurant name I'm assuming the dish is its specialty. That's why I ordered the Fettuccine Mona Lisa. 

As mentioned before one of the reasons why this menu was confusing was because I couldn't tell what is their specialty. There are several items named after the restaurant (Fettuccine Mona Lisa, Chicken Mona Lisa, Pizza Mona Lisa, and Veal Mona Lisa). There are also dishes named after the City (Spaghetti San Francisco, Chicken San Francisco, and Risotto San Francisco). Since this restaurant is on North Beach why doesn't the restaurant name some of the dishes after North Beach? Lol.

Now back to my only dish, which is the Fettuccine Mona Lisa. Two great things about this pasta is that the pasta is cooked al denta and the sauce is creamy but not heavy. One thing I didn't like about this pasta is it was quite salty due to the olives. Since the olives are cured having the olives with the ham makes dish quite salty. I would recommend either having the olives or ham alone in the pasta but not both. With abundance of items on the menu I feared that this dish would not maintain its quality. Other than the olives the pasta was quite tasty. 

Even though I only had the Fettuccine Mona Lisa today, I've eaten here before. The last time I ate here was about 10 years ago. I don't think the menu has remained the same but what I remembered was that the menu was very extensive that made it intimidating. What I ordered last time was the salmon, but there were so many different dishes of salmon I couldn't remember what I ordered. However I do remember the salmon was dry and overcooked. The fear of having too many items is some of the dishes won't be as good. Even though I've only eaten here twice in the last ten years my rating is based upon two items - a tasty Fettuccine Mona Lisa and a dry salmon. In a sense my rating is based on one word - consistency. With too many dishes consistency is hard to achieve. I feel if the restaurant cuts more than half of the dishes in the current menu I believe the quality of the food will be much better and consistency will be better achieved.

Great selection of food...one of our favorites is the lobster ravioli, but honestly everything is delicious.  Their bread is average.  Unfortunately our waiter forgot to put in our order and never came back to clear our plates after our appetizer or the salads.  Service does tend to be on the slower side usually so if you are in a rush you will have to keep onto of your waiter. The food always trumps the service and will always bring us back.  Of course we will be back again next time we are in town.

528,F B.,"This place was kind of mediocre. I've honestly had better Italian food before in my hometown. I was a little put off by the slow service. We weren't even there on a busy night. It's almost like we were forgotten. Our food finally came after waiting 45+ minutes. Ridiculous. This place was talked very highly of during one of our tours we took, but honestly I don't see why? I probably won't be going here again.

531,Kevin T.,"I'm in Frisco a lot with work,  but when here at Mona Lisa, I feel like I'm back east at a family reunion.  Great service that goes well beyond keeping your water & wine glass full. 

I have never had a meal there I would not recommend.  They are all delicious and modestly priced for SF.  

Maurizio is your host and genuinely welcomes all. If you can speak some Italian, you will find yourself having a great time chuckling up with the Maurizio and the staff as they truly enjoy hosting patrons with a jovial graciousness rarely seen.

The Pastas here are renown and the veal dishes are superb. For something lighter, my personal favorite if I am not quite up for a big meal is the Antipasto Misto ($19.95).  It is a very well presented platter (see my pics) of thinly sliced meats (prosciutto crudo, salame and soppressata), olives, cheeses and peppers.  It makes for a meal in itself and goes so well on the front patio with a favorite glass of wine.

The hostess at the front was super friendly...and had an awesome memory.  She didn't miss a step when figuring out who was next for a table.

Anyhoo, we had ordered a bottle of wine.  Apparently, they were out so the server literally ran to the other restaurant in their chain to grab one.  He ran back to us, cracked open the bottle, and it was delicious.  

The food...wasn't as great.  I ordered the spaghetti bolognese...doesn't get any simpler than that.  It was alright...we went home and made it ourselves the next day.  Much better when it's made at home...

The sampler was pretty good though.  It came with a melted garlic cheese thing (Sicilian candy), bruschetta, and caprese.  Haha.  

3 stars...but I probably won't be back.

-Ravioli Aragosta (lobster) with tomato cream sauce.

-Spaghetti allo Scoglio: white wine sauce with shrimps, clams, mussels and calamari.

We ordered some pasta and cioppino and couple glasses off wine, but with that they threw in a free appetizer in the beginning and free dessert in the end! The appetizer was what seemed to be a sampler of cheeses and meats. Very good! The dessert was some type of ice cream which was also good! That is what I call great hospitality. Little gestures like this definitely makes guests want to come back! So thank you! Great food and very authentic.

I had the chicken a magio, which was a chicken breast filled with ham and mozzarella cheese with a tomato sauce. It was absolutely delicious.

The reason why it's 4 stars & not 5 is because it took 40 minutes to get our food. I know we had an appetizer, but I mean c'mon, it doesn't take 40 minutes to make pasta and the restaurant wasn't even full.. But either way! I really liked this place & if I'm back in SF I'll go back :)

The Mona Lisa won it in spades! 
The decor and ambiance made it seem like something right out of a movie, I half expected to look over and see Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesce eating at a table.

We were warmly greeted and seated almost immediately, the service was great, Matteo was our server an he was happy to answer our menu questions and had great wine reccomendations. 

When Matteo learned it was our boys' birthdays,  he made them feel special, we felt like we were getting the VIP treatment.

556,Amanda R.,"My boyfriend and I are on vacation here from Austin, Texas and stumbled upon a whole neighborhood of Italian restaurants. We looked at the menu outside and a group outside told us that the food was amazing and that we had to try the mini calzones. We decided to give it a try. 
We were seated by a very friendly man whom I pretty much assume is the owner. He was great! Asked us if we spoked Italian. We don't but he did! Fantastic! 
The place is very decorated. It's very busy decor but almost cozy. Fun to look at. Real table clothes, gas lamps, bread and water in funky bottles as soon as you sit down. Awesome. 
Biggest complaint? Service. 
We waited 5-10 min to be greeted by our server. It wasn't busy. I heard the two servers talking about what tables to take. They were the only one on as far as I could tell before dinner rush actually started. 
The appetizer we got was ice cold. The waiter took them back and then told us that they were out of it so we got the mini calzones. Which were great. 
Main course was okay. My boyfriend loved his NY strip that he got. Although it was a little more done than what he asked for.  I got the chicken parmigiana and was so disappointed.  The chicken was tiny and tough and it cost $22.95!!!! 
My boyfriend wanted another beer and had to ask twice to get one. I asked for another glass of wine and never got it. The waiter was not attentive at all. Forgetful? Preoccupied? I could tell he was in the weeds but come on. Ask for some help from your co workers! 
Overall I paid $127 to treat my boyfriend to a birthday dinner that we will mostly remember by the terrible service of our waiter. :(

The staff greeted us in Italian and we had a place to sit right away during lunch.  It was so romantic :) the eye candy made it a great dining experience as well haha!

Fettuccine alla Piero - 20.95
light cream sauce, with shrimps and asparagus

So good!!!!! I mean really really good!!! It was served hot, fresh, and full of flavor! 

The waiter was very tentative to the table and that accent! haha!

573,Christina Y.,"I give this place a solid 4 stars. My friend and I were exploring North Beach and decided to dine at one of the many Italian restaurants we passed by. Mona Lisa gave us a vibe we didn't get from the other restaurants. Plus, they had a car outside which you could dine in.

Since it was such a beautiful day, we were seated outside so we could enjoy the weather and people watch. Split the lobster ravioli and the signature Mona Lisa pizza. I wasn't blown away with the pizza but it was still delicious. Loved the lobster ravioli though! I would have finished the entire dish if I hadn't had to share.

Extra brownie points:
-The server was extremely attentive, making sure we had clean plates, utensils, and our water was always full
-The table next to us had ordered a salad which came out twice, and our server decided to let us have it rather than having it go to waste. The dressing was yum!

I always question restaurants that are located on the big streets but Mona Lisa was delicious!

Had the spaghetti carbonara - pancetta, eggs and cheese for $13.95.  The portion size was acceptable; not large, not small either...but this dish was just unappetizing.  The pancetta bits tasted so salty and the pasta itself lacked any flavor.  My whole plate of pasta was sauceless and yet was really greasy.  I felt gross eating it after a few bites :(

Extremely slow service and not the most friendly either.  Our food came out 1.5 hrs after ordering, so we filled ourselves up with complimentary bread as we waited.  If you are in a hurry, this might not be the best place to go (we spent over 3 hours total for dinner!).

586,Alexis I.,"I came here with my boyfriend for our first Valentine's Dinner because my old roommate recommended it. We made reservations 3 months in advance because we were worried about the Vday rush. Luckily they seated us immediately next to the window even though we were an hour early. The seating was pretty cramped and the tables were so tiny that there was hardly any room for the bread and our two entrees. I think the decor was too cluttered so it was kind of distracting.

Other than that, this place is a definite must if you're a risotto-fiend like me, because they have at least 20 different selections to choose from on the menu. I gotta give them props on their menu because it was kind of hard to decide what you want cause the menu they show on yelp does not compare to the lengthy amount they actually offer at the restaurant.

I ended up getting the crab and asparagus risotto and boy was that plate larger than I was expecting. Still had enough to take home for leftovers! When it was served the food was still steaming hot, freshly cooked from the kitchen and was absolutely scrumptious. The risotto was mouthwatering and as soon as you take a bite, it's just heavenly because it had such a creamy consistency. Finished the night off with a cappuccino tartufo, which was a perfect end to the meal.

I highly recommend this place, because of the intimate ambiance, friendly staff, and the food is just too delicious to pass up!

Mauricio treats us, and all customers, as family.  The photo with the Spaghetti allo Scoglio and also sometimes I have pasta only with Calamari with double the tentacles and I usually joke that there is more seafood than pasta. These dishes are better than many times I have had in Italia. Mauricio is  very generous as he sometimes and we are only 2 people, gives us on the house a of tower of antipasti, salmon(lox), fried calamari, mortadella, capicola, prosciutto, formaggi, olive, bruschetta etc. I tell him joking that we are so full to "" take home the entrees"" !!! So now I tell him he does not need give us anything but as he is a ""Capa Tosta""---I can get away with saying this as I am half Calabrese/half Pugliese--instead of the Torre Calabrese only una Barchetta like the small boat in the Neapolitan song 'Santa Lucia"".

When I am here I can close my eyes, Italian music in the background, Italian being spoken by waiters & the beautiful different plates of delicious Italian food being taken to the tables of customers make me feel like I am in Italia. The smiles on their faces indicates they love the food.

Mauricio è molto generoso come lui a volte e siamo solo 2 persone, ci dà sulla casa una torre di antipasti, salmon(lox), calamari fritti, mortadella, capicola, prosciutto, formaggi, olive, bruschette ecc.

Così ora io gli dico che non ha bisogno darci nulla, ma come lui è una ""Capa Tosta""----posso farla franca con questo dicendo come io sono metà Calabrese/mezza Pugliese -- anziché il Torre Calabrese solo una Barchetta come la piccola barca nella canzone napoletana ' Santa Lucia "".

Quando sono qui posso chiudere mio occhi, sottofondo musicale italiana, italiano, essendo parlata da camerieri & belle diverse tavole di delizioso cibo italiano prese ai tavoli di clienti mi fanno sentire come se fossi in Italia. Il sorriso sui loro volti indica che amano il cibo.

I originally come from New Zealand and when I have out of town guests from New Zealand come I take them there as  they love it so much too.  Cheers/Grazie Mauricio!

I was actually walking for an early dinner in another restaurant, but saw the beautiful vintage car the restraint had set as additional table on the street and decided to stay.

598,Ashley D.,"Decent food, TERRIBLE service. 
PROS: The atmosphere was nice (decor, music, etc.). My husband loved his prosciutto calzone, and my friend liked his gnocchi pomodoro. You get complimentary bread, balsamic vinegar, and olive oil. 

CONS: The service! 
1. We went today around 1:30. It was not busy at all...one other group of 4 was there at that time. It got busier about 30 minutes after we had sat down. First, the restaurant was open for business, but the door was locked. We knocked, looked confused, and no one came to open the door for us. We finally got in because a customer came out of the restaurant. No one greeted us, and we were standing there for a few minutes before being seated. He told us from across the restaurant to sit anywhere. He could have at least come to the door where we were standing. Then during our meal, we saw the same ""lock out"" incident happen to a woman and her 2 children. They were locked out of the restaurant and her husband and friends were already at the table (I saw him flag her through the window to let her know where they were seated. The woman was knocking and waving through the glass window door, while the server was looking at her and made eye contact with her and blatantly IGNORED her! My husband got up and opened the door for her. 

2. It took about 30 minutes before we got our order taken. Additionally whenever we thanked the server for anything he brought us, we were ignored. My linguini tierra was just okay....not bad, but not great. I wouldn't order it again. I'd rather try something else.  

OVERALL, the food was not bad, but based on the service I would not come back here for a long time. I will try other restaurants in the area first. Too bad, because they have a large menu and their pizzas actually look quite good. I am curious to try one.....but the service was unwelcoming, and we felt uncomfortable (as if we were a burden to the server).

If I could I would give this place zero stars. It was the most disgusting meal I have ever tried. The sauce was so salty. My mouth hurt just after a few bites. On top of the nasty food the service was just pitiful. We waited 30 minutes for the waiter to take our order. And when I complained about their horrific excuse for Italian food they refused to take my plate off the bill. They did however offer to get me a new plate but you couldn't pay me to try another dish from there. So I left the restaurant hungry, pissed off and $19.95 +tax poorer.

602,Belle B.,"I have recently discovered this fabulous place from a friend who goes here often. You can recognize the restaurant by the wooden vehicle out front (you can also enjoy your meal streetside if you want to by sitting in this car). There's a great ambiance to this place. The people are also extremely friendly and helpful. You are always greeted with great smiles and an uplifting vibe.

Now onto the good stuff....FOOD! Yes it is absolutely delicious! And for me to say that means a lot since I am a little picky when it comes to what I eat. You can tell everything is fresh. We have had the apps (they have a sampler of all the apps...it is 3 tiers of different appetizers if you can't decide) and I have had the veal...yum! I have also just gone for a glass of wine and am still welcomed as I'm enjoying a full course meal with am entire party. Some places rush you out if you aren't having a full meal and spending money, but not this place. Come in for a meal, snack or just a glass of wine. If it is nice out definitely try and sit outside. People watching is great in North Beach. Each experience I have had here supercedes the last. I'm sure I will be back here soon and often.

603,Tina L.,"The customer service of the place awesome, but the food itself....it wasn't bad yet it wasn't 5 star either. It is a bit on the pricey end for me. Came here today Sunday Feb 12th, 2017 with my sisters in law and my kids. The staff was attentive and sweet they gave us a free appetizer to start. One of my sister in law ordered a seafood risotto, and the other sister in law ordered lasagna, my eldest one ordered kid sized fettuccine alfredo, and my little one and I shared spaghetti with meatballs. The portion for the adult meal in comparison to the kid sized plate was the same. Had I known it was the same portion I would've ordered two kid sized plates. I didn't even finish my spaghetti because it was over flavored and as for the fettuccine alfredo it lacked flavor and was a bit oily for my personal taste. Would I come back maybe, had I ever had better Italian food...yes. Sorry I really really love the friendly staff, but the food as for today just didn't do for my family and I. I was hoping for a 5 star Italian cuisine especially for the prices listed on the menu.

606,Chloe A.,"First and last time coming here. 

My friend and I came here on Saturday afternoon around 4 pm. There were only 4 other occupied tables in the restaurant. I had questions about the menu and also about tuna tomato sauce. When I asked our server about it he laughed at me, rude much? So I chose the salmone ravioli. Huge mistake! It was almost too fishy and salty to be edible. I was starving so I ate it trying not to gag with each bite. My friend ordered a fettichini style dish with asparagas and shrimp. Her dish was much better than mine. 

When we were finally done, I tried making eye contact and to flag down our waiter for our bill as it was never delivered to us. He never even acknowledged us. I put my card down on the table and still nothing. Finally after waiting over 15 minutes with our plates piled up on the table we were fed up and dropped cash on the table and walked out. 

On our way out the man at the door thanked us for coming in and I told him we would never be back. He acted shocked but at the same time like he didnt even care. 

If you get the server who looks like a horse (look at his teeth) BEWARE!

610,Lindsay H.,"The plan was to walk through North Beach and find a neat little Italian restaurant for dinner. With a mini wooden Italian car parked outside and every inch of wall space inside covered in Italian paraphernalia, this place is definitely quirky and what we were looking for.

Despite the cramped seating, the service was great. The temp inside was insanely hot; halfway through the meal they finally turned the AC on. 

Although the bread came out cold and bland, the rest of the food was delicious. And the portions were just perfect, so four out of five cleaned their plates. Three types of ravioli were ordered; I thought it was cool that they were all different shapes. My chef friend was disappointed that the ravioli was not fresh made and was instead from the freezer (detectable by a tough freezer-burned piece). Interestingly, the menu only listed ""homemade"" next to a couple of the ravioli dishes (including mine). The sauces were tasty and I especially liked my ""Ravioli ai Quattro Formaggi"": creamy and rich. I added Italian sausage, which probably would have worked better in a red sauce, but I needed my meat.

Prices were pretty high, especially if some of the dishes are actually defrosted and served. Pasta is cheap and easy to make, so I don't really think the high prices are warranted.

612,Ashish N.,"I was raised in Italy and I know Italian food very well: my father is a chef and i myself like to cook. 

I went to this restaurant for Christmas eve with my friend because of the good reviews . The environment was very nice and warm but the food was really bad. We both ordered risotto with Porcini.  The rice was overcooked, there was no salt, and no taste at all. Porcini mushrooms were not good either and they tasted strange.

The service was really bad too. The waiters didn't listen to any customers. One of then poured the water all over the table while he was aiming to the glass and didn't do anything about it.

The owner come nearby me and poked me and told me to eat fast. I was horrified by the service. Normally, I do not like to make big deal out of anything at the restaurant so i left without saying anything.


Bottom line: I will never go back to this restaurant and i would not advice anyone to go there.

613,Alison F.,"I am a total foodie and I absolutely loved Mona Lisa! The service is impeccable from the moment you walk up and you're greeted by the owner, whom attempted to speak to us in Italian (which I absolutely loved) to the server that was extremely prompt and courteous. I also enjoyed the intimate atmosphere with eccentric decor and open kitchen to be able to watch the cooks prepare your food. They don't have food warmers, which is a refreshing change so your food will come as soon as it's prepared, hot and fresh!
I ordered the lobster ravioli and you could tell by the texture that the pasta is homemade and the lobster is fresh! The sauce was creamy and just the right amount of herbs. My husband had the Napoletana pizza and it was one of the best pizzas we've ever had. The crust was buttery and flaky. 
We enjoyed it so much that we went back another night before we left San Francisco and the owner actually recognized us as we walked up! He had an appetizer sent over to thank us for coming back again. The experience was even better the second time, if that was even possible! This restaurant feels like you're eating dinner with your family in Italy!

614,Carla J.,"Mauricio saw us walking past the Mona Lisa and invited us in!  That was a nice way to start dinner - feeling like ""FAMILIA!""

It was nice to see olive oil and balsamic vinegar on our table to go with the bread, none of which is in short supply at Mona Lisa Restaurant.  We all drank water with our dinner, and it tasted good (filtered? Although I know SF gets Hetch Hetchy water, so it just might be great tasting anyway).

There are definitely enough choices on the menu to make anyone and everyone happy!  We had two adults, two teens, and two kids in our party.  Everyone was super pleased with their meals.  

We had spaghetti alla pescatore, fettuccini Alfredo, fettuccini with crab, two orders of spaghetti with meatballs, and finally an order of fettuccini Nero with calamari (squid ink in a white wine sauce).  That last one was for me and I was thrilled to see so many tentacles in my dish, not just the rings.  I mentioned loving the tentacles, and so our waiter hooked me up!  His name was Mario F., and he was simply an excellent waiter.  My daughter commented about how impeccably clean his long sleeves were!

The ambiance was fun, and there was definitely a lot to look at on the walls... Even a Mona Lisa that, um, forgot to cover her top half!

But at Mona Lisa, apparently you can. I had two layers of pasta and the lasagna was topped with chunks of meaty sauce and burnt chunks of sauce and pasta. Out of hunger, I peeled all the burnt bits and ate it, and when I brought up the burnt lasagna chunks to the waiter, he simply said it's supposed to be that way because it was in the oven.

I ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese and it was WAY TOO SALTY!!! I could not eat it, so I asked the kitchen to add some cream sauce. They looked at me strangely, but did so and it was much better. I still did not enjoy it that much. I think I should have stayed with what I had previously, which was either the veal or chicken piccata.

The bread that came to the table was very good and so was my glass of wine, a Lambrusco. My mother in law enjoyed her food and my husband thought his chicken parmigiana was decent, although it had the same salty meat sauce.

632,Gabrielle W.,"I lived in San Francisco for 15 years from 1989-2004.  I even worked across the street from Mona Lisa for awhile, and I never got the opportunity to try the dining experience here.  Today, visiting on vacation with my family, that all changed, and I'm so grateful.  Having been here a week, we've had many interesting dining experiences.  On the last night of our vacation, I wanted to take our family (visiting from out of state) and local San Francisco guest to a place that would make our time here mean something.  Tonight, Mona Lisa delivered.  When I called for a reservation early in the day, I was greeted with kindness and positivity.  We walked in at 6:30 and we were greeted again with the same upbeat kindness as I experienced on the phone.  We were led to a beautiful and comfortable table and promptly offered drink and menu choices.  They then brought a complimentary antipasti platter, which was delightful.  I have to say, the experience was seamless.  From drinks to apps, to salad, to main course, I was so impressed with how well everything flowed.  I waited tables in this town for years, and I was touched to be in an establishment where pride in service and quality of food still mean something.  If we were just adults dining here, it would be easy.  But in addition to impressing us, they managed to delight and impress my two small children as well.  I had the gnocchi.  I'm so glad I saved half of it.  It was so good, I look forward to eating the other half for breakfast.  My family raved about how delicious everything was.  Even though we were totally full, we had to order a Tiramisu to share.  I'm so glad we did.  It was perfect like everything else.  As we were leaving, the owner was so kind, inviting us to visit again.  I was looking for the right place to completely make our last night in SF memorable, and from beginning to end, Mona Lisa delivered.  They are humble, elegant, fun, and delicious.  It will be a destination stop on every visit from now on.  Thanks Mona Lisa!  You keep my faith in the heart and soul of a city I truly love.  Great job.

It took the food a little longer to come than the usual waiting time I thought, but I was busy catching up with a friend so I did not mind or really notice it much and I was starving so that helped.

Meats, poultry, seafood - perfect

Not sure about all unpleasant comments below... I never had (and hopefully never will) a bad experience at this place. Especially pay no attention to some indian dude, who wrote ""the pasta was undercooked"". That's what a real ""al dente"" pasta taste like - you idiot! 

Any ass can cook regular pasta at home...

Real good authentic Italian food though. Would definitely come back and recommend this place for anyone who likes pizza and pasta. There's so many different types of pasta vegetarian, seafood, meaty. Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed.

644,Liz G.,"After exploring North Beach with the bf, we had a hankering for Italian and were drawn to the cute outdoor tables at Mona Lisa. 

The service really was impeccable, and exceeded our expectations. The host seated us immediately and water and bread was served shortly thereafter. We were just enjoying mulling over the extensive menu when our host walks by and apologizes for the wait. We hadn't even thought that we had waited a long time and were just enjoying the sunny day. Our waiter came a couple minutes later and again apologized for making us wait, even though we weren't inconvenienced and comped our appetizer for us, which was exceptional given the (lack of) circumstances.

The bruschetta was truly delicious. Tomatoes usually aren't very ripe in January but the tomato topping tasted fresh and flavorful. Our Diavola pizza had a nice, crispy/chewy crust and was scrumptious as well. Our glasses of wine were well-priced and impressive for ""house wine"". 

Again, the staff literally went above and beyond the call of duty during our meal. We hadn't noticed anything lacking, but they still made our experience memorable. We will be back the next time we want Italian in this neighborhood.

Anyway, he ordered a salad and I ordered the prosciutto and melon and we shared a pizza. He enjoyed his salad. i enjoyed my prosciutto and melon and the pizza was eh. A little on the dry side but the prosciutto on top was yummy (can you tell I love the stuff?) 

Overall, dinner was ok, company was better (and better looking). Maybe next time I can try something else and my review might change.

We conversed back and forth for a minute before deciding to sit and eat. I wanted to order something that wasn't on the menu (gnocchi in fettuccini sauce with shaved truffle... I have a crazy truffle addiction lol) and they gladly accommodated which is always appreciated! My boyfriend got fettuccini pasta with fettuccini sauce, salmon, peas, and mushrooms. My boyfriend also ordered a glass of their house wine (not sure if it was Pinot Noir, Cab, or Merlot lol). The owner/manager also treated us with a plate of delicious assorted appetizers.

There is not one thing on the menu that disappointed me. The feel of the whole place is very relaxed and homey. I felt like I could have been at my family dinner table. The place is coated in art and fabric and flags and maps...as if someone just got back from a tour of Italy and had to stash all of their knickknacks somewhere. I love it.

The food and ambiance here are always on point and their waiters and waitresses are very friendly and knowledgeable. The food here is outta this world, healthy portions and easy to share with friends and family. This is my go to spot in Little Italy - above all else make sure to ask for the tiramisu for dessert.

664,Thomas D.,"I finally had a chance to visit Mona Lisa Restaurant for lunch.  I enjoyed the service and the ambiance very much.

  The food was so-so.  There was nothing that really stood out as an original inspiration--I had the  Rigatoni Alla Borrelli - 15.95
(baked rigatoni with sausage and eggplant in tomato meat sauce)
This was a bit tasteless even though it included sausage.  It was also oily.  The rigatoni did not taste homemade.  It was overcooked and looked like it could have been leftover from the day before.

The beef carpaccio that we started things off with was good--very true to its Italian roots with arugula, capers, lemon wedges and pecorino cheese.

Dining companions enjoyed the Gnocchi ai Quattro Formaggi - 14.95
(four cheese-cream sauce) and the pizza Calabrese - 13.95
(Garlic, tomatoes, oregano, sausage, cheese)

After finishing our meal, I asked the owner for a check and his response was ""who is your server?"" How am I supposed to know that, and then he proceeded to do nothing so I had to track down a waiter to get me a check. As the owner, with all the photos you have around the restaurant showing yourself off, maybe work on your customer service.

We were originally trying to eat lunch at the restaurant next to this one, but that was closed. I was sucked in here because I love Mona Lisa and the Italian guy at the door greeting people. It was actually kind of embarrassing because we passed the guy at first then decided to eat there. Hah!

We walked in and the greeter asked us where we wanted to eat. As he was leading us towards our table, he said he liked me so he's going to give us free appetizers--- the freshest bruschetta bread!

I ordered the pasta with salmon, my boyfriend ordered alfredo, and our friend ordered chicken with potatoes and other delicious sides. We tried each other's entrees and they were all equally delicious! Like I said from the beginning....THE BEST Italian and pasta I have ever had so far.

Besides the food being amazing, the service was bad ass as well. Everyone there was helpful, friendly, and I loved when they would say ""Grazi."" The way they said it was so sincere and respectful =)

674,Greg S.,"North Beach...with a throng of Italian restaurants to choose from, how do you know what's good?

On this particular evening, I let my eyes do the walking. I passed Mona Lisa Restaurant and looked through the open windows to see beautiful chandeliers and ornately painted ceilings. That was enough to pique my interest!

The menu looked to have the standard fare and the wait was only 10 min, so it was decided. When we were seated, the positioning of the table was not ideal; I was sitting in a high traffic area for the wait staff. But I pulled close to the table and made the best of it.

The wait staff were courteous and as attentive as they could be on a busy Saturday night. The kitchen really seemed slow and it took a while for us to get our food. I'm not sure if they were unorganized or if they were just slammed, but for a pasta dish the wait was longer than expected.

I ordered the Penne al Forno alla Calabrese, a baked penne with meat sauce, ham and mozzarella. It was piping hot when it arrived at the table, much to my pleasure. It was overall enjoyable, but nothing spectacular.

Overall, I think Mona Lisa is pretty standard Italian food. It was good, but didn't knock my socks off.

Perhaps next time I'll follow my nose!

My husband had spaghetti with meatballs, I had the Gorgonzola tortellini with a glass of white zin. The spaghetti was the best we've ever had, and hubby *always* gets spaghetti & meatballs when we eat Italian so we had a lot to compare to. My tortellini was amazing but it was my bad for adding Parmesan cheese to my cheese tortellini which was covered in cheese sauce--a bit too salty for my taste. Next time I'll skip the Parm but we can't wait to go back and re-live the perfection. Bellissimo.

One friend had the antipasto (lots of meat - great deal for the price) and another had the spinach salad (lots of walnuts) with a side of meatballs. The sausage and meatballs were both great!

678,Tony R.,"Of all the Italian restaurants in North Beach I chose to come to Mona lisa on an early friday evening, prior to going to the Giants game. The restaurant itself is kinda small and very intimate, the main kitchen is in the front of the restaurant, so you can see and hear as the chefs make your food.

The menu is a little intense, there is a very large selection of pastas, pizza, seafood, chicken, and beef, I felt like I was reading an Almanac. I had a hard time deciding what I wanted but settled on the Ravioli al Quattro Formaggio (homemade ravioli in four cheese sauce) , Mona Lisa Pizza (Pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, peppers, cheese), and the Spaghetti and Meatballs (spaghetti and meatballs lol). 

The food didn't take too long to arrive, when it did at first my eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach, my plate had only 6 raviolis and was sure it was not gonna fill me up. The raviolis were really delicious, the However as I continued to eat them I became both full and unable to handle the taste. As delicious as they are, they are very rich and cheesy, It'd be good to get this if you were sharing with someone. The pizza was thin crust, crispy, tasty sauce and full of flavor from the veggies and meat, One of the pizzas is a good portion size, good for 2 people. The spaghetti and meatballs were okay, I mean the dish itself is pretty standard, a good spaghetti isn't gonna wow me that much. Overall I was very pleased with the food here, definitely will be a place I come back to again.

682,Adnan O.,"It is an interesting story and overall it does deserve 3.5 stars for our experience.
but i see the restaurant manager's effort to make things better this place deserve another chance but god knows when we can find it and i am not even sure that i will give another chance rather than trying new places since we live in midwest :)
But hope fully they will get consistency with the service and food at the same time..

Here is the story:
2 couple + 1 baby.
Late dinner (close to 10pm)
not much customers around. 
------------------
1st of all decor would be really impressing if they did not try to make the restaurant look like a touristic place. All the flags takes away from the beauty and authenticity from the restaurant.  
2-Food was good quality... Not saying amazing but good... 
I love the idea of open kitchen which was partially open so i can see the cooks on duty... 
We've got veggie lasagna, margherita pizza and four cheese ravioli, all of them was really good... 
3-The catch on this place is. at least for us.. waiter did not see us as a spending customer. We did not order any wine or any other expensive things. I do not wanna say he was rude but he was definitely on the edge of it.. He was not disrespectful but sometimes you feel it he can go to that direction really easy and quick. 
Since the service is the most important thing for me for a restaurant i would lean to give 3 stars according to my experience...

They were extremely crowded, yet did their best to seat all comers, and were very accommodating to us, even though we were 35 min early for our reservation. 

Once we were seated, the server was gracious and prompt, nothing like some of the reviews here. The owner also came over a couple of times - once while we were waiting, and once while we were eating, and also while we were waiting. Everyone who worked there was calm and hospitable. The first thing the server said when we sat down, after asking us if we had to wait a bit, was ""I will do my best to make it up to you now"". 

The food was delicious and plentiful - probably the best and most important part of the review!  We started with Calamari and Bruschetta, and then we each had either salads or pasta for our entrees. Everyone left happy and felt like it was a great North Beach experience- not easy to achieve on a cold, rainy, crowded holiday evening!

The waiter spilled cream sauce and oil all over the patron, her clothes and bag (unintentionally) and when the matter was addressed with the restaurant manager, he told us to ""take it up with the waiter"".

Food, as appealing as the food is, i ABSOLUTELY don't deal with rude.  Nothing is more unappetiziing.

So heres the scenario, I was really in the mood for some italian and seafood right off San Fran. I pulled up on the patio outside, unknowing of my company - ordered the spinach salad and the risotto and mussels. 

I patiently awaited, the waiter forgot my beer. Then, after not being prompt for bringing it... criticized the busboy for forgetting. This is just the beggining...

As I got my salad, a few pedestrians walk by - and I hear this table of four making a mockery of anyone walking by -  I thought to myself - (jerks) and blew it off.

Then my main plate was served (or better stated Shoved!) , not giving me time to finish, and was rudely shoved the main plate in front of me, as if to hurry  things along(??) - 

 while I was only mildly disappointed, I then noticed a lady ask if they could also join on the patio with a dog they had. They owner feigned not understanding English well - then - as they walked away exclaimed ( Che catzo! che mangiamo caca?? - WTF? Do we eat shit here? How about we eat dog shit soup?? - at that point - I lost it, and yelled at him ""Ya Basta! Che sto mangiando!"" and his pathetic response - ""Scusi? Scusi"" and I had to repeat myself to him. Only to hear back -  ""Ooooooh! Parla italiano!?"" (he speaks italian) -

 the remainder of th meal, he turned his coward back to me with his real cool mullet and wanna be mafiosos and inwardly heckled. 

As I left, I gave him a hard stare, of which he couldn't bring himself to look me in the eye.

Sorry Guido, but...  next time, even though I may not look italian, I studied romance languages - douche bag!

I had a hard time deciding what to get, because I had so many options. The service is a bit on the slow side, but it was also 8pm on a Saturday night.

Food in a city, I'm sure things happen. But ten minutes later, one on the table next to me. In the daytime. I think I'll wait a while before coming back. Hopefully, they'll fix this problem soon.

Although the dining room is small it's intimate and cozy.  I'm always about the food, and the menu was so extensive it was hard to choose just one entree.  I ordered  the gnocchi and it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  I've never had better.  

The bottle of wine we ordered wasn't in stock but the bottle they recommended was even better.  Our waiter was absolutely adorable and we all got a good laugh when he couldn't understand a joke we told because his English ""wasn't so good.""

Of all the choices in North Beach, this one is definitely worth the visit.

713,Kara T.,"Such a disappointing North Beach restaurant.  The area has become so toursity (and seedy with all the nearby strip clubs).  I liked the decor so came inside and was dismayed to see ""$12 per person minimum"" on the menu.  I nearly left but we decided to stay. The cheese pizza was odd , with a liquidy pool of milky cheese on top making the crust soggy. Having just returned from Italy I can assure you it was NOT authentic nor was it really recognizabe.

The arugala salad was excellent (with capers and lemon) although a little light on the fresh shaved parm.

For a small pizza, arguala salad, cup of tea, and 2 milks for the kids I felt like we paid WAY too much.  Mona Lisa is a tourist trap I'd recommend you avoid.

Next time I'm in the area I'll be sure my YELP app is working (sadly, it wasn't loaded right on my phone) and if in doubt, I'll try for a side street over the main drag.

714,Kristina L.,"While the host was fantastic (and the reason for the 3 stars), the food was mediocre at best. The house salad's ""creamy italian dressing"" tasted like it was made from Miracle Whip. The cannelloni was okay but the sauce was oily. The bread was very good and the olive and oil dip was good. Overall a bit over priced for the quality.

715,Fred M.,"Scary bad! I have to rate it one star because zero is not an option! Caesar salad: Made with mayonnaise as a base, or a REALLY cheap store bought dressing. Chicken San Francisco: Chicken drenched in salt topped with canned artichoke hearts. Gnocchi Fondenti: Think mashed potatoes and cheese. Also they are so proud of the wine by the glass that they don't list the brand and the won't let you taste it, is it still 1965?

Unfortunately we wasted a dinner in a wonderful food town like San Francisco. Please learn from our experience.

716,James L.,"My friend and I must have looked like tourists when we went here for lunch.  

We are given menus and wound up ordering a Caesar salad to share along with individual pizzas.  As we were finishing up our lunch, I found out that we had been given dinner menus instead of the lunch menus.  On the lunch menu, the salad was $2 cheaper and some of the pizzas were also a few dollars less expensive.

When the bill came and I saw that I had been charged the dinner price for the Caesar salad, I complained.  The waiter argued that the dinner Caesar salad was bigger, which is why we were being charged more.  However, he eventually agreed to lower the price.  

After he walked away, I talked to the people at a neighboring table.  They had ordered the same sized Caesar salad but said that they had ordered it off of the lunch menu.  In other words, the waiter had been, in the language of diplomacy, disappointingly inaccurate.
 
The food itself was O.K. but nothing special.

717,Margo J.,"A group of us, 9 to be exact, spent a day at the treasure island flea market and decided to take a drive to North Beach.  We didn't have reservations anywhere and being such a large group I didn't think we would get in anywhere.  We happened upon the Mona Lisa and Marcello, was kind enough to move all of the outside tables to accommodation our group.  When we shared that one of our grandparents was from Calabria they hooked us up with 2 appetizer platters at no charge.  The platter had prosciutto bruschetta and cheese an olives...a perfect antipasto plate.  We also had the candy (roasted garlic) very tasty.  The service was very attentive and the food was good.  We had many different dishes and the seafood risotto was one of the favs.  It was interesting to see all of the negative comments around service.  We actually had 5 star service.

It all starts with Maurizio greeting you at the door with some of his jokes, then if you sit outside you have a beautiful view on the heart of North Beach and if you're inside you're surrounded by all sorts of colorful decorations and pictures of the many international celebrities who have been there. The menu is great, you'll always find what you're craving for in there, and the food is fresh, tasty and authentic. My favorite dish is the risotto allo scoglio, a beautiful looking dish, perfectly cooked with amazing seafood. Maurizio will likely surprise you with complimentary appetizers and those are just amazing! Portions are abundant and you'll feel full but you have to try the tiramisu as well, probably the best I've ever had!

723,Lisa D.,"I don't know where to start...like a kid in a candy store? Ate here for lunch Sunday afternoon. The menu is very extensive and portions are large, with each plate approx. $17. There were only 3 or 4 tables so we had excellent service. Our server and busser were both very friendly and attentive. Our drinks and basket of hot bread arrived quickly, and our appetizer came out fairly quickly as well.

The dessert menu was fabulous, and all desserts are $8. I purposely didn't touch any bread, and took it easy with the calamari and my pizza so I could indulge.  

 They offered to box up our leftovers, which we declined as we had a flight to catch. Wasn't expecting that, but was very impressed. Heated seating outside. Here's our notes:

Caesar salad - homemade croutons, lots of dressing if you like that. 

Calamari Fritti- Light crispy coating, these were delectable.

Pizza Napoletana- crispy crust, but pales in comparison to Tony's, which I had the day before. Cheese, garlic and tomato blend was perfect but will not order this again. Next time I'll try the Margherita.

Gnocchi Fondenti- If you can't get enough cheese, then this one's for you as it was dripping with cheese! This is a light fluffy gnocchi, not as doughy as we had a few days earlier at Fior. It was softly tender and melted in my mouth!

Chicken Parmigiana- small portion with no pasta, accompanied with decent potatoes and spinach. Lightly breaded and very tasty. 

Tiramisu- Lovely, light and  heaven in your mouth. Always the perfect end to a wonderful Italian meal.

Chocolate Protiferoles - these little cream puffs were smothered in chocolate - OMG I thought I was going to have to buy an extra plane ticket for my ever expanding fat arse!

Chianti - how do you screw this up? Large wine glasses - gotta love that! After the Chianti, we had another red, Valpolicella Cesari which was excellent. 

Loved this place! I would highly recommend it for a romantic dinner.

729,Ken W.,"Mona Lisa is one of our ""go to"" restaurants in North Beach.  I would say that many (most) places on Columbus are over priced tourist traps that serve mediocre food at elevated prices. Mona Lisa is not cheap... but the quality and service are always very good. 

I highly recommend the veal dishes and the pastas are very fresh and never disappoint. Caesar salad is very good. Service is always good. Decor as you might guess is Mona Lisa / Italian style. 

Side note: I took my wife here a couple years back on her birthday and we had to wait about 30 min for a table even though we had a reservation. The owner (or manager) was very sorry about the wait and brought out some champagne and sang to her while we waited. It was a class move and it made the night very special for her. 

This is one of the few places in North Beach that we do not hesitate to recomend to people.

740,Annie P.,"If your looking for authentic and tasty italian....come to Mona Lisa. My friend and I were on the prowl for Italian and came across this place. It looks small from the inside but its quite roomy once you walk in. We were seated promptly and the customer service was on point. The man who seated us stands out in front and greets guest....luckily for me he also helped scare away the meter maid! Thank you! Who puts 30 minute MAX meters on streets w/tons of restaurants?! Ridiculous! I had to go out to my car every 30 mins to ante up on the meter! YIKES! Almost didn't enjoy my lunch BUT I still did!!!! Muahahaha. Here's what we ordered:

-Fried calamari $13.95
-Risotto Pescatore $16.95
-Linguini alla silana $13.95
-1 coke
-1 sprite

Keep the bread, butter and vinegar & EVOO cominnnn'!!!!! :)

-Fried calamari was pretty tasty and the portion was HUGE. My friend and I added a ton of crushed red pepper to the marinara sauce. Spicier is always better! 
-The Risotto was sooooo bomb! Best Risotto I've ever had! My friend who is in love w/Risotto absolutely fell in love with it. It was very creamy and cooked to perfection. Some places cook the Risotto way too long and it loses the Risotto rice texture but Mona Lisa did it perfectly. No wonder it took awhile for the main dishes to come out. It was worth the wait!
-The linguini alla silana was very good also. It definitely tasted home made for some reason! Hahahaha. The mushrooms and eggplant went so wonderfully w/the sauce. It was delectable! Momomomom.

One complaint...
#1. The restaurant obviously is pretty famous because there were photos of celebs up everywhere who have eaten at Mona Lisa! Which was fun to look at. However, I felt very clustered and bunched in. Too many tables crammed into one restaurant....half the time I was trying to zone out other tables conversations and listen to my friend talk. It felt intimate but invasive at the same time. BUT it also ment that Mona Lisa probably gets very very busy! Personally, for me...the tables were put too close together

All in all definitely go try Mona Lisa. The service is very good and the food is so tasty and authentic! I'm definitely going back!

Don't get fooled by the music and the ambiance, once we got seated it was the most depressive music which killed our mood to go out after. The service was also really bad, we had to wait a really long time for everything even though it was only 2 other tables.

I think we came at the wrong time because the restaurant only had 3 other customers and us, yet our waiter forgot about us. Quite sad actually, we were just sitting there starving and tired. We ordered a dish of risotto and I ordered a simple tomato basil pasta... terrible! The foods tasted like it was in the fridge then heated up on high heat. The pasta tasted like it was either undercooked or overcooked, we couldn't tell, but it was doughy and weird tasting. I saw the cooks taking the tomato sauce out of a container and heating it up on top of the pasta. I'm sure this is a great restaurant, or maybe my tastebuds are wrong, but we def didn't enjoy our meal. I think the owner came up to us and saw my place still full, and said in a cute Italian accent ""please finish, for me, please eat"" *hand gesture for eating*. =]. I ended up not finishing my pasta... I think we paid way too much for these foods, and they gave us Italian portions...

For lunch I ordered the Ravioli ai Quattro Formaggi. The four cheese sauce was so good, but very rich. I ate half the dish and most of the four cheese sauce to dip the bread they bring the table (which was dry).

Something about the older Italian dudes, sitting out front at their usual table discussing todays events with vigorous hand motions interests me to no end. And this is all before walking into the place. 

Once inside it's a very romantic atmosphere with low lighting and a very nice decor. I am always treated very nicely, if I'm dressed up for an evening out or sun burned and sweating in my Dodgers jersey after watching my boys smash on the Giants at AT&T Park. The service is always great and quick. I also like the way you can watch the cooks work their magic as the kitchen is right up front. 

The food is delicious! I usually go for the ravioli or chicken parm. Never had an issue of any sort here. By far, my fave restaurant in Northern California. My first all time being Miceli's in L.A. Mona Lisa is a close second.

But one quick chat with the guy at the front who essentially said ""I don't care if you have a reservation or not. We are busy, just wait"" was enough to walk away.

764,Justin S.,"Nothing to write home about but I will be back. In a city with a million great restaurants it's extremely hard to stand out but this well established North Beach favorite has been around because the food is good and the service is above average. When we arrived at 8:05 on a Tuesday evening with no reservation we were promptly seated at the second to last table. Within five minutes all the tables were full.

The huge menu was a little overwhelming but after much discussion I ordered the Mona Lisa Fettucini and she had the ravioli. She mentioned the raviolis were a little ""saucie"" and I have to agree but it was still good. The Fetichini was good not only because the pasta was extremely fresh but the sauce was was full of flavor although not in the top ten for this city but still darn good.

The ambiance is a bit cluttered but even with every table full the restaurant is no too loud. I give it a low four stars but will be back in the future.

Everybody is so friendly and charming, just like italy and the food it is simply delicius.

You must try also the amazing PIZZA they make, OMG never had a pizza so good in USA!!!!!
Can't wait to go back again in this restaurant.... i Leave in San diego but everytime i go to San Francisco i never miss the opportunity to enjoy the magic atmosphear and the Delicius italian food in Monalisa.

When you step into this place, it looks quite dark. No worries though, your eyes will adjust to it. The decor is quite nice, but it can get a bit crowded. I had the Chicken San Francisco, which I originally thought it had some pasta, but it was chicken, potatoes, spinach, and other veggies. I thought it was pretty good. However, the potatoes were quite salty.  

The waiter seemed like he was in a rush. He came and took our dishes without really gesturing whether we were ALL finished with our dishes. My friend still had food on her plate, but she was pretty much done.

When it came time for the bill, the waiter jotted down the wrong prices on both of my friends orders. Their dishes were a few dollars less than what he initially wrote. When we asked him about it and showed him the menu price, he told us that it was busy and they calculated them by hand. Fine, but he only corrected one of the dishes and not the other. He was so in a rush that he did not correct the entire bill to what it was suppose to be. So we took the time to calculate it ourselves. 

Despite of the ending, I would maybe consider coming back because there is such a huge selection of dishes here and the dish I had was good.

I was also able to enjoy their beaded calamari, I loved the fact it wasn't heavy breading.. Light & flavorful.

We than shared the carpaccio, do not get this, it had been plated many hours(days) before, and the thin slices of meat stuck to the plate and had gotten hard and crusty.
Wonderful deserts, all four of them!
Big downfall is no hard liquor, I really craved a drink before dinner.
There are many great Italian resurants in SF, this one has atmosphere, great food, and most of all a family of Italians meet you at the door, and you feel like you have been going there forever, I value this aspect.

We were seated in the back of the restaurant where the tables were so  close that waiters and customers walking by would bump our elbows if we stuck them out too much.  It was also too warm, so much so that I broke a sweat when the food finally came. Btw, it only took 1 hour to serve our food. Once they did, they got one of our orders wrong. When we asked our waitress, she reassured us it was the right plate. By that time we were fed up and took a couple bites of our meals and asked for the check. Needless to say, we will not be returning to this establishment.

The white wine seafood risotto lacked the bold flavors I've grown to love and expect. The spaghetti carbonara was just ok, mainly because the sauce didn't have the  rich cream base that the salty ham is supposed to balance out. 

Overall a decent Italian restaurant in North Beach, but not the type of place that gives me flashbacks of living in Rome. If you are looking for a good North Beach date spot, look elsewhere.

786,Carolen M.,"Why do I not have good experiences in North Beach?  *Sigh*  Perhaps it's just Italian food and me don't mix.  So last night a group of us went to dinner here before we were going to dance the night away at Dragon Bar (look at my review there).  Let's break it down.

~ Neighborhood ~
Situated in the heart of North Beach, it's one of your busier restauarants.  It's right across from Steps of Rome on the corner of Columbus and Vallejo.

~ Parking ~
There are a few parking places.  The China Town Parking Garage charges $2 for every 30 min.  NOT WORTH IT.  Go a few more blocks north to the Vallejo Garages where it's $3 every hour (first hour is $1, past that from 1-2 hours it's $3, 2-3 hours $6, etc).

~ Restaurant Atmosphere ~
The restaurant has, as my friend stated, a European feel.  Many tables are set up, close to each other, and it feels like you're in an alleyway in Italy.  Also all the Italian being spoken was great.

~ Food ~
They give you lots of bread which my friends devoured as we were waiting for our food to come out.  I got the Grilled Mixed Seafood Entree.  It came on a sizzling plate with potatoes, spinach, salmon, 2 shrimps, and tuna steak.  Nothing special actually.  I felt it was overpriced grilled seafood.

~ Service ~
Slow...but I think that's to be expected.  It was prime time dinner and it's in North Beach.  It took maybe half an hour to get our food.  We were so hungry.  

I just feel like I can get the same quality food, better service and at cheaper prices...but again this is North Beach.

Incredible food and amazing staff!  We travel over 50 miles (Sebastopol) to eat there and have never been disappointed.  They always accommodate special request and actually made me a dish not listed on the menu.  That is something I would never request at any restaurant but they are not like any other restaurant I've been to.

Almost every time I have come here, the owner comes to my table with a huge 3-tier serving platter of bruschetta, garlic bread with cheese, roasted vegetables with fresh cheese, and sets it on my table saying it's on the house.

804,Juliet S.,"Ok food...but this place is hyped up a bit too much. There are millions of places just like this in the neighborhood...where the experience might be better.

Or original plan was to get some wine and split a pasta (it was 3 in the afternoon), and we just really wanted to taste the delicious food everyone was raving about even thought we weren't that hungry. 

We took too long to decide I guess because the waiter came back to ask us if we were ready to order about 20 times. He kept suggesting an antipasti dish so finally we asked which one was good and he said the bruschetta and the antipasti platter. Some sort of miscommunication happened then and he said ok...I'll get those for you. This ended in me chasing him down and explaining that we just wanted the antipasti platter and not to spend over $50 on just appetizers. 

The antipasti platter turned out to be a tray of lunch meat and some tiny pieces of cheese with some teanie tiny olives for around $20. 

By the time we got to that point in the meal we decided to forfeit and get our check (which visably upset him because he was thinking we were getting pasta). Oh well.

I'm sure this place is amazing, but my experience was just one of the worse ones. My favorite thing about italian restaurants is the servers because they're usually so nice and friendly. If you want amazing food apparently come here, but if you like friendly (patient!) service go somewhere else.

By the way....the menu has about 200 pasta dishes on it...how do they think people will pick one in 10 mins??

This place is pretty authentic - most of the waiters looked and spoke Italian.  The service was fast and our waiter was as cute as a button.

 Anyway, the prices were cheap for San Francisco, and the food was decent.  Not the best Italian food I've ever had, but it was definitely good.  They have a HUGE menu with about a zillion types of pasta and a zillion types of sauces, so there's definitely something for everyone.  They also have a variety of meat dishes and risottos if you're not in the mood for pasta.  Overall, I'm glad we stumbled into this place, and we'll probably be back.  

Oh, and parking around that area can be a bitch, but try the North Beach garage around the corner on Vallejo between Stockton and Powell.  We had no trouble finding parking there.

809,Blair A.,"Let me start off this review by saying that I am from Texas. Austin, Texas to be exact. When I walk into any restaurant I expect to be greeted warmly, chatted up by the waiter (usually), and then left the hell alone to enjoy my meal. It is the Austin way. 

I was in town for some training and a colleague and I, on recommendation of another colleague, stumbled to Mona Lisa for dinner. I'm a creature of habit when it comes to masticating my food, and whenever I'm in an italian restaurant I'll scarf down on Eggplant ANYTHING.

After pouring over the menu (because it has multiple pages all in phrases like ""Eggplant -insert italian word here that Blair doesn't know-"") I finally decided on the Parmigiana di Melanzane. I was BLOWN AWAY by how insanely delicious this dish was! All it was seemed to be thinly sliced eggplant delicately layered across each other to form a bit of a dome, then a divine marinara sauce was covered with Parmesean and Mozzerella strewn throughout. 

I say, ""All it seemed to be"", but let me tell you, dear yelpers, that it was enough! My face about exploded in happiness. The tanginess of the sauce combined with the tenderness of the eggplant and creaminess of the cheese seriously transported me to Italy. Our waiter was incredibly sincere and nice, and the doorman had quite the crush on my colleague and gave her his personal ""calling card"" with his crazy italian accent at the end of the night. Dinner AND a show? I'll take it!

Like I said, I live in Texas and I've legitimately thought about hopping on a plane back to SF to have a taste of this dish again. Weird? You betcha. But I'm from Austin and that's kind of our slogan!

810,Annie D.,"Decided to stop in here to have some dinner with friends. 

We got seated pretty quickly on a Saturday night, place felt dark and a little clustered. 

We wanted to start off with calamari, but they ran out...
So we got garlic bread and Antipasto Misto - mix of prosciutto crudo, salame, cheeses, olives and soppressata. Garlic bread was really garlicy, I had that taste in my mouth until the next day...it was still pretty tasty. The antipasto was pretty good, not that much meat of each, maybe 2 or 3 thin slices, but good to wet your pallet before dinner. 

Lingiuni al Nero di Seppie - black squid linguini with calamari in white wine sauce- I've had this dish at other places, this one was ok, it was pretty blame and needed some more flavor, maybe more salt. I guess they had some squid left?! =P

Also had a bite of their meat spaghetti, lobster ravioli and Don Mario pizza. Those were all pretty tasty and everyone seemed to really enjoy their dishes. 

Services was pretty good, seemed too busy to come back and check on us.. we would have to wait or waive them down when we needed something. The food is decent for having so many choices up and down the street, I can't say it's the best, but maybe because my dish wasn't the best.

814,Cara S.,"After spending lots of time Yelping for the perfect Italian restaurant to take friends the night before our wedding, I decided to wait until I made the trip from Houston. 

Our hotel turned out to be walking distance, a mile or so away from Mona Lisa, so on many walks about town we passed the place. I was worried because it looked small and we were going to have seven people. When a gentleman from the restaurant approached me outside one day, I asked if that was OK and if we could make a reservation. He said it would not be a problem, and gave me his business card. The next day I called and made the reservation. I ended up having to change it to eight people, and they were still able to accommodate us. 

The pace of the meal was great; the service was adequate but not above and beyond; but the food? Absolutely amazing! I have been home for a few days and I'm still thinking about it! I will definitely go back next time I visit San Francisco. 

Here's a list of some things my party ordered, and I will also post pics:

Appetizers:
Calamari Fritti - 13.95
Tomatoes Caprese - 12.95

Dinners:
Tortellini al Gongorzola - 13.95 - My vegetarian friend ordered this, although there are lots of vegetarian options. I went with the gnocchi but this one tasted great too! Everyone wanted to taste everything so there was a lot of sharing taking place. 
Gnocchi Ruggero - 16.95 - I had this. It was gnocchi with gorgonzola cheese sauce, walnuts and spinach -- HEAVEN! 
Gnocchi Fondenti - 14.95 - Baked four cheese-cream sauce with nutmeg. For some reason the baked dish seemed to come in a smaller portion. My friend had asked about sharing this with her husband, and the waiter rightly recommended against it. However, my portion for the Ruggero was definitely enough to have been shared. 
Ravioli Aragosta - 16.95 - Lobster in tomato cream sauce. Two in my party ordered this and I had a couple bites. It was also fantastic. 

We skipped dessert because we were off to Ghirardelli for ice cream, which I'll probably Yelp next. Definitely try the gnocchi or ravioli if you go -- Mona Lisa does it right!

Why not five stars? The place only has beer and wine, and for beer Peroni hardly counts. Sorry. I did have an Anchor Steam, though. Can't go wrong with that. I did wish they had some fancy pre-dinner mixed drinks or martinis, though. Also, the waiter said it would be a $3 refill for sodas. I don't know if we were not charged after all because my party really wasn't happy with that and they might've overheard, but yeah, that's just kind of ridiculous if that rule is actually enforced.  Lucky for us, it wasn't. 

To address some other minor complaints from fellow Yelpers, I found the decor cheesy yet entertaining. It made the place fun. As for the space issue it's San Francisco. Every restaurant I've been to there has tables close together you just sort of have to deal; at least they took our reservation and hooked us up with a nice long table in the back.

The Verdict: Just thinking about that gnocchi makes my mouth water. I can't wait to go back.

817,Barbara D.,"Ghetto Fabulous Italian Restaurant. 

The decor reminded me of an old Italian woman's cluttered home but it had a close familia' feel. 

The penne arrabbiata with a side of sausage (yum) was a bit above average & mixed with pink sauce per my request...cool thanks. But the crab ravioli was a bit too fishy and just OK. The Burgess Syrah really complemented the spice of my pasta. 

However, the tool of a waiter was quite annoying...trying to sucker us into getting the more expensive wine. It's one thing to know what you're talking about and know your wines but to obviously try to sneak a different wine under your nose just based on the price....classless & sneaky. The guy just wasn't comfortable in his own skin and it was obvious.

My wife said her spinach salad was make out of leaves that she would have thrown out.
I ordered Oso Bucco in a ""white wine sauce"". When it came it was totally smothered in a brown, gravy-like substance and had the appearance of a cow pie. Seriously, whatever meat was under the ""gravy"" was cooked to smithereens, was tough and way too salty. I asked our waiter about the ""white wine sauce"", and he looked like a deer in the headlights. He said he'd check and came back to me saying ""yes that's the wine sauce."" Even he looked surprised.
My wife had a salmon & pasta dish that she said was terrible. I REALLY wish I could say somehting nice about this restaurant, because we enjoy going to SFO for lunch in North Beach and have rarely had a bad meal in that area. 
The 5 star reviews for this  place make me wonder if we just got a very bad day or what. We won't risk our money and our stomaches again to find out though.

819,MisoSoup O.,"Last night we celebrated My Hubby's BD. Went to the place after a recommendation of the Marriott's Concierge. 
Great things: The food, the service and the portions. Our kid got gnocchi with meat balls and alfredo sauce. The best dish on the table and it was hard to compete with the cioppino, some salads, calamari, risotto and 2 other veal dishes. Very tasty but make sure you request less salt.
Good things: The music. Some updated or old dated (like San Remo) music will be appreciated.
Parking: Challenging but we had a spot in front of the restaurant
So why only 4 starts? It is a charming place with excellent service and great food, but! - the restroom. The owners must take some actions there, how much is a renovation of a tiny toilet is? 2K and it is all tax deductible. When you see an old, not clean enough, with dirty rugs toilet rooms-  one will be very concerned about the sanitary and some other health issues.

We skipped the appetizers and had break with oil and balsamic vinegar. 

I ordered Lobster ravioli with a creamy tomato sauce, $18. My bf ordered a seafood linguine with calamari, clams and shrimp in a marinara sauce $18. 

We decided to skip dessert. I was stuffed. I said that it was one of the best meals I ever had...the wine was good too, but I brought that. 

My recommendation: If you bring wine, bring a magnum so that its worth it, and try the lobster ravioli. It was just divine.

825,Jeff C.,"Growing up in an Italian family, I was spoiled by all the great food my Grandparents and Mom made for us.  That said, I'm very picky about Italian restaraunts since they have to compare to the delicious home cooked Italian meals I'm used to having.

When our family was in SF over Christmas break we were looking for a place to eat and the owner was outside inviting people walking by to come in to eat.  He and my Mom were speaking in Italian to each other and she decided we'd eat at Mona Lisa.  It was packed, full of energy, and smelled so good.

He sat us down in the middle of the restaurant and said he would bring us a special appetizer.  What he brought out was something not on the menu, but was a special ground sausage dish that his Mother always made.  It was so good and he gave it to us complimentary.

The rest of the meal was delicious, great sauces, al dente pasta, and delicious bread.  The meats and seafood were succulent and everyone was very pleased with the dinner.

It was a great night, meal, and a fond memory of our time in SF.  Some people on here say Mona Lisa is ""touristy"", but if they serve really good Italian food, who cares?

One tip - the bread is hard and room temperature. I'd prefer soft and warm.

827,Aaron G.,"This restaurant is a hold-over from the American Italian dining experience of the 60s and 70s. The menu is too long; who wants to read through 200 entrés? It also doesn't give you confidence that they actually prepare anything well.

We tried the ""family platter"" of appetizers, so got a taste of various standard Italian bits and bites: buschetta, melon with prosciutto, etc. That's hard to screw up because it's largely about just getting fresh ingredients.

My entré was the baked eggplant. It was inedibly salty and pretty drab. Tomato sauce was nothing special, pasta was hard and overcooked. I complained about the saltiness but the waiter didn't offer to do anything about it. I will give it to him that he made good wine recommendations. 

The evening was on the pricey touristy side to top things off... I certainly wouldn't go back.

Walked around all the Italian places nearby before finally deciding on this one. It was a Thursday night and this place was super busy. Asked the dude in the front how long the wait was and he said he had some tables for two. We decided to sit outside although I kinda wish we would have sat inside to check out the decor. 

The waiter was prompt with our order and we decided to get the Spaghetti Aglio e olio and the Penne Salsa Rosa. They served us some bread and butter while we waited for our food, and we got to people watch until our food arrived. My Penne Salsa Rosa was amazing, it tasted just how I had imagined it. My friend liked his as well but he said it was a little too oily for him. I could only finish 3/4 of it because I had eaten a few hours prior. I wish I had more room so I could have tried some dessert or at least finish my pasta :( . 

The italian guy in the front kept talking to us in italian and according to my friend he kept saying to eat up, since we were both pretty stuffed with food still on our plates. The owners are really nice and warm with customers and the waiters are pretty attentive, or water was being filled up every 5 minutes. It took a while to get our check, but it was pretty busy and I didn't mind.

Loved this place, want me some Sala Rosa.

It was our anniversay and I guess they overheard us talking about our anniversary because after our meal (I'll get to that in  a minute) they brought us a big piece of Tiramasu wiht ""Happy Anniversay"" written in chocolate sauce on the plate! It was the best Tiramasu I've ever had hands down. Our waiter wa a smaller sized young man who was absolutely phenominal! The food was crazy good and I am actually a chef with Italian in my background. I ordered linguine with the meat sauce and meatballs. I also paid the extra $4 for the hand made pasta which turned out to be the best 44 I've ever spent. This place is classy and a great experience from the minute you walk in the dorr. My wife got a chicken dish with a light wine sauce that had artichoke hearts and Sicilian olives. It was to die for! Two big chicken breats on the plate with fresh sauted spinach and roasted potatoes. I will make this place a stop every time we travel from Elk Grove to the city for sure

833,Rob L.,"TOURISTY ITALIAN EATERY WITH SURPRISINGLY GOOD FOOD

There was a long line outside the door so we were hesitant to ask how long the wait would be.  The host told us it would be just a few minutes so we decided to wait.  In no time, we were led into a stuffy, crowded dining room to a cozy table.  The menu had so many choices that it was hard to decide.  I thought the prices were a little steep but we were in North Beach.  We decided on the following:

Sicilian Candy--We started with a big bowl of roasted garlic that tasted delicious on the bread.

Antipasto Misto--A platter of prosciutto, salami, soppresata, olives, and assorted cheeses arrived at the table.

Spaghetti allo Scoglio--White wine sauce with shrimp, clams, mussels, and calamari were delicately tossed with perfectly cooked pasta.  I love it when the pasta is cooked al dente.

Linguini allo Squalo--L ordered the linguini with a rich tomato sauce of swordfish, salmon, shrimp, mussels, and clams.  He said the seafood tasted fresh and I totally agree.

The waiter was very entertaining and was always right there if we need more water or wine.  We were hesitant about trying this place because it seemed so touristy but we were pleasantly surprised by the friendly service and the quality of the food.

835,Dee Z.,"If you happen to be alone and want to go out to eat, this place along Columbus would be perfect. I was just checking the extensive menu in front when they commanded, ""Table for one..."" - and I just followed; I was hungry anyway. Whoever decorated the place just went hogwild, with the autographed photos, busts, sculptures, paintings on the wall, paintings on the ceiling, the lights in the front, the servers with Mona Lisa ties (...you can really tell who can tie a tie) - the place was a total crack up. Of course it's for tourists, but the locals can enjoy it as well.

You better have an idea of what you want to eat, it has the most offerings of an Italian restaurant I 've ever seen as it runs a couple of pages long in a small font.  I had a house salad, which I thought was tasty because they chopped the tomatoes up enough so you could really taste them. I had their cheese ravioli and osso buco (could have used more of what the dish is famous for). Both dishes were fine...but when I got the dessert menu was when I had my flashback - I was back in Rome - reading the dessert menu of about 15+ items - knowing they did not make their own desserts. Don't get me wrong. It made me wonder why their menu was so long - I hope their dishes are not premade and frozen - the food tasted fine and, frankly, if I'm in the mood, I love the Italian ornate scheme of the restaurant. 

There were lots of people in and out so I don't know if it was a combination of tourists and locals. I would go back again - it's a fun place to practice your powers of observation while having a nice Italian meal.

Something odd happened. The bill was ~$86 & my friend put down a $100 bill. The server rejected it & asked for a smaller bill...seriously??!!! He even asked one of us to go next door to see if anyone could break a hundred! A good waiter would do that for you! Apparently the explanation was that most people charge their bills & they didn't carry much cash in the restaurant. Ummm, most restaurants I've frequented love cash & don't like credit card charges bc of the fees. So, he never accepted the $100 & my friends had to find 20s to use instead. Very strange!

It's designed to attract unsuspecting tourists, and its clear the staff caters specifically to this audience.  Upon signing our check, the owner came over and told us we needed to wrap things up quickly because he had another reservation.  So rude.  We asked for our leftovers to be boxed up, and when they didn't show up back, we asked.  Our server ran to the kitchen, and came back to let us know that they were already thrown away.  No apology, no offer to correct the situation.  Just a blatant response, and he was off to another table.  As we stood up to leave, a bus boy accidentally stomped on my girlfriends foot, turned to look at her, and then went back to what he was doing.  Again, no apology.  

This place is nothing but a crap restaurant designed to churn and burn through unsuspecting tourists, with very little regard for customer service or quality.  They clearly know that they won't see any repeat business anyway, so why try.

850,Suzi K.,"Where's that 1/2 star when you need it?  2.5 stars for this Italian joint.  I would've rounded up but I paid good money for a meal and I didn't get anything in return.

Me and the GF decided to have an adventurous Friday night.  Get totally wasted and walk around North Beach aka Lil Italy looking for some squid ink pasta for her.  We walked on and off the beaten path and ended up here, Mona Lisa Restaurant.

First off, if you let someone sit outside on a fairly cold night, you should give them a discount.  I felt like I was an hour advertisement for this place since there was a lot of foot traffic and everyone and their mama was looking at our food.  

On to the food...
Garlic bread:  It was basically the free bread that they gave but with butter and garlic.  It wasn't even soft and fresh.

Antipasto Misto (meat n cheese appetizer):  The prosciutto was good.  Unfortunately, the meats were a bit cold.  Not so fresh cold cuts from the fridge? Probably.

Lingiuni al Nero di Seppie (squid ink pasta):  The GF was so disappointed.  The squid ink did not taste fresh at all.  She something along the lines of ""I didn't know you can get squid ink in a can."" Nuff said...

Risotto allo Scoglio (Seafood risotto made with a white sauce):  Very bland flavor.  The prawns were overcooked, had itsy bitsy clams, and I don't think I saw the mussels.

Normally, being drunk lowers the bar for flavor in my food.  This place just did not satisfy that drunk hunger we had and everything was less than okay.  The best part of the meal:  It was Friday night and I was drunk. :)

The menu is very large... a little on the overwhelming side especially because everything sounded great. We started with the Bruschetta, Calamari Fritti, and Sicilian Candy --- the first two were standard but the Sicilian Candy was very yummy and of course garlicky so  be sure to bring some gum if you plan to order this! : )

For the main course, I ordered the Salmone con Gamberetti alla Crema and it was SO very good!! I tried the Risotto al Porcini and Gnocchi al Gongorzola from friends at the table and both dishes were excellent. Another friend ordered the Chicken Marsala and it was oddly sweet in a not so good way, so I would recommend staying away from it. For dessert we had the Cappuccino Truffle and it was incredibly delicious.

859,Mindy S.,"This was certainly the worst Italian food I've ever had. If you can call it food. And this dining experience certainly is in the running for worst paid meal I've had in some time. 

We wanted to go to Franchino's. We walked over there after consuming some delicious Dead Guys at the Rogue Public House. Unfortunately, it was closed. In our inebriated, famished state we looked around for the first place that looked decent. And there, before us was Mona Lisa. It looked clean, inviting and pleasant inside, so after checking Yelp to see that it had a decent 3.5 rating, we decided to give it a go. 

We realized upon entering that there weren't that many people in the restaurant and all of the patrons were crammed in the front of the house to give the illusion of a very busy cafe. Oh well, we had a nice spot by the window. We ordered - garlic bread with cheese, Chicken Saltimbocca and Spaghetti Carbonara - really standard, generally very easy to prepare Italian fare. 

Ugh. I'm still trying to shake the garlic bread. So unbelievably garlicky. So unbelievably bad. My pores are oozing garlic. My breath is so incredibly smelly and this, over 24 hours later. I don't know if the garlic was bad or if there was simply too much of it but it's a powerful stench. And I love garlic. 

Then the Spaghetti Carbonara. Salty. So salty. And then I found a giant piece of egg shell in my food (unfortunately too late, I was crunching on shell for the rest of the night). The Saltimbocca was watery, raw looking and had a smell to it. Not a pleasant saltimboccay smell. 

Anyway, we alerted the waiter to the shell in my carbonara. He apologized but that was it. No adjustment to the bill. 50 dollars later, I spent the plane ride home to DC gripping my stomach and hoping that my row partners couldn't smell the stench of garlic upon me. If this is what passes for Italian food in San Francisco you can count me out. I don't know a single Italian from Rhode Island (the Italian capitol of the country) that would serve nor prepare what I ate. 

Curse you Franchino's for being closed!

861,Crystal H.,"The worst place to eat in San Francisco! There are so many other places to eat that are better with better service! I just ate here recently and our server sucked!!!! And this place is clearly family owned because all the servers pay attention to their family/friends drinking espresso outside. The only way they want to talk to you is if you put your credit card out on the table before even bringing the check to you!! The price for what you get is over priced!!! They barely give you anything for a plate that cost $20 the server completely left my table never took our plates not brought the check! I will never eat here again!!!! And the food is plain!!! Buyer beware!!!

862,Quelli L.,"For my 21st birthday I wanted my family to get together and have a great Italian meal as well. Now my family and I are frequent visitors to San Francisco, so we were looking for something that would send us over the top. What we found was this little whole in the wall, meet your neighbor next to you, and scrumptious food. The staff was wonderful. 
Now to the food: I had Tortellini with a fresh pesto sauce that was amazing, my mouth is watering as I am typing this. All the other dishes that my family had were amazing as well. The Veal Mona Lisa was exquisite, it tasted like butter. I  am planning to celebrate my 24th birthday in San Francisco this year, I believe we will be stopping by to enjoy this wonderful place again.

865,Rox T.,"This place has a VERY LARGE MENU. I have not tried nearly half, but I love it because a few things. 

1. Their cioppino is a repeat order. I love to order a side of cooked spaghetti to mix in with the soup once it's half eaten. Changes the meal a bit. 
2. Sicilian Candy (roasted whole garlic cloves) is also great used as a bread spread. 
3. They have plenty of wine to choose from, but I tend to stick with the Chianti Rufina. Something about Chinati and Sicilian/ Italian food is a must. 
4. The staff is awesome and the owner loves his heritage and conversation. 

I would love to sit in this restaurant all day and try a bite of everything for a more legit review, since they have so many different things to offer.

866,Angela F.,"Intimate Italian restaurant in North Beach...but then again...aren't all the Italian restaurants in this area small and intimate? I've tried a few Italian restaurants in North Beach and this one wasn't any more memorable than the others. Service was very attentive and friendly.  

Bread before the meal
-crust was a bit too hard...it would be perfect if the bread came warm 

Gamberoni Piccata - $20
(prawns in white wine, lemon sauce with capers)
-prawns were very fresh and tasty; good portions; dish was a bit too salty though

Risotto Alfredo with Prawns - $17
-good taste and portions; you'll enjoy this dish if you like very heavy and rich sauces

The menu is very extensive so I would come again to try other dishes.

Good salads and they brought out a killer appetiizer platter.    Very good prices, super service, at the end of the birthday event they brought out a bunch of small desserts,  so I give them a solid 5 stars.
This is the kind of place that North Beach is all about, great service and food and just an enjoyable event, they treated us very well.

We sat outside for lunch and had a wonderful view of the church across the street, so Nice ambiance, check.

The maitre'd (owner?) was cheeky Italian, insistent that his place is the best, and we obviously deserved the best. Treated well, check.

There was an entire bus-load of Italian tourists eating inside, and they all seemed very pleased with their experience. Must be a good sign!

Thanks to the full house, our waiter was incredibly busy. He was still polite and made sure we knew we mattered also. Another treated well, check.

Now for the food...WOW! I had the Gamberoni Piccata, and my mom had the Fettuccine Mona Lisa. In spite of enormous portions, we cleaned our plates. The house bread is wonderful too. Terrific food, check.

I feel it may help to mention that I live in Houston, and it's not bragging to say we have our fair share of fantastic restaurants. I am truly picky, and can say that Mona Lisa is top-notch.

874,Wendy M.,"This review is long overdue and based on the actual experience rather than the food (did not actually eat a full meal here):

On a first date we went ""Italian restaurant hopping"" down North Beach. Getting an appetizer at one place, main course at another, etc etc. 

Anyway, as we were walking down a friendly man said hello and to please come in! We said we'll just have a glass of wine since we just ate and still welcomed in. 

We asked to sit outside because it was such a nice night out. The owner of the restaurant [I think] also came outside to say hello. I honestly forget how the subject came up, but we had told them we were on a first date and they went all out for us. 

They brought us a candle outside to make it romantic. Brought us some cheese for the wine we were sipping on and basically made the entire experience something to remember. 

They never made us feel unwelcome because we just wanted a glass of wine. 

Unfortunately, we did not try any of the main dishes, but on our anniversary we plan to repeat our path down and will definitely make it a point to come here again for some Italian food and wine!

My veal marsala was tender, but pretty much tasteless and served luke warm.  Fellow diners who tried the parmigiana were underwhelmed by the sauce.  
The salads were not impressive and most of us left our dessert, tiramisu (I think) on our plates. 

Maybe the restaurant is okay for individual tables, but they cannot handle large groups.

876,Therese H.,"So this review is a bit tricky....

I would have given a 3 1/2 star review for this place for the food and service. 

Upon leaving the restaurant however, I removed my purse from the hook, which was hanging under the table and noticed something moving. Upon closer inspection I saw that it was in fact a cockroach. 

This cockroach apparently had climbed into my purse from under the table. 

I didn't want to make a huge scene as the restaurant was full, but maybe I should have let out the supressed scream after all. 

The manager offered to comp us wine for our next visit, which quite frankly will never happen!  

I walked to th nearest parking lot, dumped the contents of my purse, and retrived said bug. 

After getting the little critter into a envelope, I returned to the restaurant and was met on the sidewalk by the manager. 

I handed him the bug and he offered to comp the bill. 

I appreciated this although sadly, I was left with a bad feeling in my stomach and a strong desire to chuck the remaining contents of my purse into the nearest garbage can.

877,Robert G.,"We tried this restaurant a year ago while in San Francisco. It was so good that it was a must stop again this year on our vacation.  The owner is very friendly and allowed my daughter to take a picture in his vintage Fiat parked outside. Custom paint job with Mona Lisa on the Hood and all wood interior. It definitely attracts attention for the business. The place is filled with Italian memorabilia which gives it an authentic Italian feel. The fact that the staff all speak Italian does that as well. They have an extensive menu, but if you want something custom they will do that for you as well. So far, we have only made it through the first few pages and ordered the pasta dishes and they have been very flavorful. Good homemade pasta and excellent sausages. If you like good Italian sausage than by all means try theirs. Their wine selection is also favorable. Plan on spending an hour to an hour and a half for dinner just to enjoy the atmosphere. Save room for desert, as they have a great and flavorful selection of those as well.

878,Nancy H.,"Was treated like royalty last weekend at Mona Lisa. Wasn't planning on staying and eating. Just wanted to sit and relax our feet from walking all over the city the entire day. The owner and the waiter both greeted us, and brought out the menu. Couldn't say no to authentic Italian pizza, so we split one while sitting out on the patio.

The wooden convertible Fiat 600 was parked outside the restaurant, I thought it was just a regular car parked like everyone else. Tourists and passers-by kept photographing it.

The owner was very charismatic and definitely knows how to market his restaurant. Once we were done our pizza, he set up a plank/table above the front seats and gestured me to sit in the back of the car. That's where me and my friend ordered pizza and felt like celeb's while random people walking by started taking our photos. It was a hilarious, unforgettable experience with fantastic food and dessert.

Taking away a star because the waiter seemed to ignore our request of no onions on the pizza - he was telling me it was good for my stomach and I had to have it. I really despise onions, I will eat anything but onions. Thought that was a little strange, but maybe that restaurant doesn't like to customize things on their menu. Understandable. So I picked the onions off :)

879,Jim M.,"Been to Mona Lisa a few times over the past couple of years and used to make it a regular stop whenever I visited San Francisco.  .  We had reservations, but arrived a bit late (about 15 minutes).  The host was nice but the manager seemed to want to 'punish' us for being late.  At least that was the gist of what I overhead in Italian.  (So, if you make reservations, be on time!) 

The decor is nice, though.  You do feel like you are in a restaurant in Italy, but on a weekend night people are really packed in.  Of course, that is a lot like Italy, too.  :-)

Maybe I just ordered the wrong dish on this trip, but I was not impressed.  I usually like their pasta dishes but all of the pasta dishes we ordered on this trip seemed to be a bit short on flavor.  With so many great restaurants in North Beach and San Francisco, we probably won't be back to Mona Lisa anytime soon.  At least not on a weekend night.

880,Nick B.,"I've been coming to Mona Lisa for several years now, and have always had a really consistent experience. My fiance's family has been going here for at least 7 years now, and it's our go-to Italian place when they visit us here in SF.

You CANNOT judge the food by the surroundings. The place is... over the top, to say the least. When they say Mona Lisa, they friggin' mean it. There is literally a ten foot Mona Lisa plastered to the ceiling. Ridiculously ugly murals everywhere, tons of autographed photos, dozens of random flags... they have found use for about 98% of all wall and ceiling real estate. I'm surprised they haven't started using the floor.

ALL of that being said - we love it here! The staff is excellent. They treat us like gold. Always very helpful, funny, and kind. They always seem to be hustling, but never once have we not been treated right. Smiles seem to be constantly draped across all their faces, and they treat each other like family. I can only assume some of them are.

The food is also great. The portions are, as expected based on the decor, massive and glorious. Huge plates, excellent sauces, and great, great veal. My personal favorite is the veal picata. The downside to their great food is the ridiculously overdone menu. Instead of just saying ""we have these ten sauces, these 5 noodle types, and these 8 meats"" they literally write down every possible combination. Just reading the menu is exhausting. 

Overall, I really like this place. The reasons they get docked a star - 1) the menu. 2) every time I take someone new here, I have to preface their terrible decorum. I feel like it's so overdone that it detracts from the place. Great food though, and I'll be returning for a long time coming.

We had some excellent Wine, snacks- the food and service was so amazing- we came back for Dinner- I LOVED the Osso Bucco over Polenta. PERFECT! We cook authentic Sicilian and Italian- and were beyond impressed- we thought our Nana was in the kitchen! The next day, Sunday was the cities big Columbus day Parade, we came to Mona Lisas AFTER the festivites, bringing our extended family and were greeted as old friends, Mauricio fawned over my Mama! He remembered what wine we drank, and what our appetizer was - sat all 8 of us inside and our server remembered us as well, an our wine choice. AMAZING!

It was expensive for lunch. The service was alright but spotty. We were seated right away but then it took quite some time to get water and then even longer for them to check back on us. 

One of the girls in my group had the lobster ravioli which we all agreed could've been crab. It didn't have that sweet or rich lobster flavor we would have liked.

They started off with an excellent 3 tier platter of meats, calamari, bruschetta , tomato with mozzarella cheese paired with fantastic wine. For my main course the sea food mixed grill which was salmon, swordfish , prawns and scallops all delicious accompanied with potatoes and spinach. Desert was tiramisu with various types of gelato. All excellent. But the owner and his staff really made my night. Mauricio and his staff were very funny, witty , and just great people still able to have a blast with their patrons and yet still manage to provide excellent service to a packed restaurant.

First of all the ambiance is great and makes you feel like you've been transported to Italy. The combination of painted murals, lighting and other decor elements gave it a great vibe. We were greeted by a very nice Italian guy at the door who walked us to our table right away. 

Once we were seated is when our wonderful evening really began. Our server Franchesco was great!! He was very friendly and provided us with top notch service. 

We started by ordering the Sicilian candy (roasted garlic), caprese salad, and calamari. Each item was better than the next, yumm! My husband had the Penne al Forno, my brother in law had the calzone, and us girls split the meat lasagna and parpalle porcini (I think that's how it's spelled). For dessert we split the tiramisu and some cream puff soaked in rum......yuuuummmmmie! Since I had a chance to taste each item I can say honestly that everything was extremely good and I can't wait to go back.

I really liked the Antipasto Misto, the prosciutto and cheese was soooo yummy. And for the pasta, I can't decided if the Tortellini is better or the Gnocchi (I forgot which sauce it came with... but it was either the Gongorzola or the Four Cream Cheese Sauce.) I like the Tortellini al Pesto, because of the delicious pesto sauce. But the gnocchi was so creamy and soft. 

The Lingiuni al Nero di Seppie was ok, it isn't as rich as the tortellini and gnocchi. But it still had a lot of flavor. Not to bad, but definitely like the others more.

The service was ok, but inside the restaurant felt really small and cramped. Still, the food is really good. I would definitely come back.

898,Matt G.,"I have been reading some of these negative reviews and must say my party and I did not experience anything close to what they have to say.

I attended with my friend Carl, and Chewbacca made an appearance (you'll have to see for yourself).

We were greeted by the very friendly manager (owner?) with a glass of wine. This made us feel at home and we don't even speak Italian :). It was a Monday night, but the place was still pretty packed. After a brief conversation with the manager over our complimentary glass of wine, we were promptly seated.

The manager recommended bruschetta and calamari. When he saw that we only ordered the calamari, he brought us a plate of bruschetta to try. These unexpected treats where management goes out of their way to surprise and make you feel welcome are part of Mona Lisa's charm and uniqueness. This is true Italian hospitality. The Calamari Fritti was superb as well, and I'm picky with my calamari.

Before our main dish, we ordered a bottle of Merlot per the server's suggestion. We relied on the server because the wine list was so long. His recommendation was great; we went through 3 bottles of it over the course of our meal.

For my main dish I had the Lasagna al Pesto, which is cheese lasagna with pesto sauce. To die for. My friend Carl had the Tagliata di Manzo, steak with rosemary. Before he gobbled it down I had a couple bites. Simple, succulent, everything a steak should be. Just enough garnish to bring the taste out without distorting it; a fine balance.

It might have been because we ordered 3 bottles of wine :), but the manager insisted that he also treat us to dessert. He brought out homemade Tiramisu and Coppa Caffe, along with a cappuccino for each. I've bounced around North Beach for awhile and have yet to find better Tiramisu.

Ambiance and mood were nice. The Mona Lisa painting on the wall demanded most of my attention. High ceilings are important to me (repressed claustrophobia perhaps?) and Mona Lisa provides enough breathing space for me to feel comfortable. The open kitchen is also a plus.

Mona Lisa is a place I'd bring a date or a few buddies. It's romantic and quiet in parts, but expansive enough that a larger table can raise the volume a bit.

900,Jaimie M.,"It seems like people either love or hate this place!  I'm in the minority since thought it was fine.  Not amazing, not horrible, just decent, solid pasta and snacks.  I pass Mona Lisa twice a day, every work day.  On the way home, the owner/staff is usually outside beckoning passerby inside, like most places in North Beach.  I'm always thrilled when one of the two tiny Fiats are parked outside - so cute!

Last Friday afternoon around 6 pm I passed by a table of (Italian) folks dining al fresco - looked like so much fun and the bruschetta and calamari looked delish.  So we headed inside - WHOA.  Decor is jam-packed, over the top, filled with all manner of themed pictures and knick-knacks.  Made us wonder if this was all part of the original set-up, or if everything had accumulated over time.  

Anyway.  Bread came straight away and was a little stale, not my favorite.  I am big on bread.  We ordered calamari and bruschette which were both good, a little heavy.  We split tomato gnocchi, which came nicely separated out into two little bowls.  Very nice, the gnocchi itself was just okay, weirdly soft for some reason.  Service was very nice - a little over the top theatrical, but attentive and very friendly.  Overall a fun place, but with all the similar restaurants in NB, not sure I'd go back.
