2,Eric M.,"Fog harbor fish house, what can I say about this 5 star seafood gem on Pier 39?  I think I can say plenty.  

Fog Harbor is on the second level of Pier 39, I visited this weekend on a touristy trip to San Francisco.  I chose FH due to the Yelp reviews I read prior to traveling to San Francisco.  

Saturday night dining, and here I thought I could make a 7pm reservation around noon and be good.  Haaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!  No way, 430 and 930 pm is what they had available.  I asked the hostess if they still accepted walk ins around 7pm or if it was reservation only, and she said they took walk ins but the wait could be 60-90 minutes.  FH is popular, and for good reason.

Anyway, I digress, I discovered on yelp you can add yourself to the wait list.  Holy smokes!!!  What a brilliant feature.  So, I went to a bar and had a few drinks and added myself to the wait list and figured I'd be good to eat around 630 pm.  I also added that I was a first time diner and to dazzle me.

 I showed up at 624 Pm which is what the app recommended.  I was promptly seated in one of the best seats in the house.  Overlooking the marina, Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge.  And I was able to watch several sea lions frolic on the piers.  The view was Amazing at sunset, I couldn't have been seated in a better location.  

I started out with a seafood tower, $88 price tag.  It had Maine lobster, oysters, mussels, shrimp, ceviche and crab legs.  It was very good, however; I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for value.  For the price, get another entree.  

For dinner I had the scallop and crab risotto.  It was awesome.  Risotto was cooked to perfection, scallops were cooked to perfection and the dish was delicious.  It was on the specials menu, and it was fantastic.  

They brought out the desert tray and of course I splurged since it was a weekend getaway.  Apple crisp, chocolate cake and crepe brûlée.  All 3 were outstanding.  I must also admit I had several cocktails, the Manhattan is outstanding as is the blood orange margarita.  

Overall, I'm giving FH 5 stars, the location and view coupled with the meal, makes it a home run in my book and a must visit if you're ever in the area.

3,Ana B.,"We went to SF to celebrate my brother in law's birthday, my brother in law is an excellent culinarian, so it was hard for me to find a place that would at least meet his expectations 

His daughter told me that he rarely goes out to eat and when he goes he goes to Fog Harbor Fish House so we went

We were a group of 8 and a small service dog we were seated at a corner by the window on around table 

Unfortunately, I don't recall our server's name but he was Hispanic (maybe spaniel ) he was very knowledgeable and attentive without being pushy 

We all started with a Moscow mule and clam chowder and they both were delicious 
We order at least 3 more rounds of mules 

We also order two towers and they were good and enough for us all 
We asked for grilled chicken breast for our 4 legged son and he rushed the order 

The desserts were the bomb especially the blondie, the bread putting and the apple crisp a la mode and they brought a dessert with a candle to the birthday boy 

My daughter is a vegetarian and our wonderful server was able to make her feel welcome and very special 

I didn't give 5 stars because coffee was up to the rest of the food and the long wait

4,Edward A.,"Nice little spot in the middle of Pier 39 where all the tourists congregate. Make a reservation or be prepared to wait - thankfully we did thru the YELP way in advance! Great location with a couple of sides having a view of the bay. As you might imagine, menu options are heavily on the seafood side but they have burgers and steaks too.......but..... 

I was torn with so many options but decided on the Cioppino. They offer a lazy option where all the seafood is ""shelled"" for you but this is one time I wasn't going to be lazy. Count on getting messy with some random splatters as you enjoy the seafood tomato broth. There's really no other way than to just ""get in there."" Filled with crab, fish, clams, scallops, and mussels the bowl was well worth the $35 price tag.

A rare gem considering the location of being in the middle of tourist central.

5,Natalie C.,"The food was so good that I came here twice during my short stay in SF! 

Both times I order the crab meat salad and they were loaded with crab meat! All the ingredients were really fresh - crisp romaine, unbruised avocado. I dont know what they use in their dressing, but it was GOOD! A perfect balance of tanginess and creaminess. I have to say the flavour wasn't as good the second time I had it, guess that proves it's house made and doesn't come from a bottle. 

We ordered their famous clam chowder in the sourdough bread bowl. The chowder was definitely overhyped, it taste like ones you get at a regular western cuisine restaurant. I definitely expected more from a seafood focus restaurant by the pier.

The lobster tail was well cooked and the meat was mildly sweet. The favourite part of my meal was the pan fried scallop. It had a nice sear on the outside, but the interior was soft and supple.

Their seasonal special, pan fried scallop with crab meat risotto was also very good. Similar to the scallop in the lobster dish, the scallops in the risotto were perfectly cooked! The risotto was cooked al dente. Even though the photo looks like they gave us too much sauce, it was perfect once you start eating and enjoying the dish.

We wanted to try their fish, so we ordered the mixed grilled, which consisted of salmon, cod and shrimp. The salmon was decent, don't have much to comment on the shrimp but the cod was disappointing. It was stiff and flavourless (except for hints of saltiness from the seasoning)

I would say it's worth the splurge to eat at Fog Habour every now and then, but choose your dishes wisely.

6,Phung D.,"I've always wanted to try somewhere new and stumbled on this one. When I arrived to the place, I had a feeling this would be a tourist trap. It turns out it was.

It's right smack where Pier 39 is and located upstair. It gets tad crowded on the weekend. They have Yelp waitlist but if you have 9 people like we did, had to come in person and get on the list. Luckily it took us only 15 minutes. 

The price is a bit steep but it's SF & at a tourist spot. We ordered couple appetizers to share such as oysters and calamari. I thought both were okay. Don't do oysters here. It's tinyyyyy! As for calamari, I felt like it was mostly batters, and not much squid. 

I also had clam chowder from a bread bowl. The chowder was okay. It's best to get a regular bowl because they give you the same bread for starter anyways.

As for the main course, I shared this seafood pasta. I think this was the best they have to offer. But still not good enough for me to come back or bring any of my guests back. They give a lot of seafood with this dish though! Overall, all the food was meh & not worth spending money on.

7,Bev C.,"So far everything is very good.  I love Scomas's but decided to give this a try!  Had the crab cake appetizer comes with a little bit of greens and mango could be a little fatter on the cakes but good.  

Our Waitress Gia is so nice didn't rush us to decide and was honest when given what I asked she gave it to me honestly and I appreciate that, otherwise might not like my dinner and nobodies happy so far excellent their clam chowder has won us over. Ok just got our entrees and they're beautiful!! Steak is perfect 

Gotta go foods getting cold lol!!

Just finished everything was really extremely good!  Coming back to celebrate my Birthday and my sons too!! 

Trust me peoples for me to rave about somewhere other than Scomas is amazing, but this restaurant was great I gave it four because they don't offer  scallops I love me some deep fried scallops with a little pasta and veggies. Also steak fries would be a better choice.  But still coming back with about 12 of us

8,Cindy P.,"We went to dinner at the Fog House last night and it was wonderful. Food was delicious and service was outstanding. It's located on Pier 39; you will need to walk up a flight of stairs. 

We were seated at a table next to the window and the view was beautiful. We made reservations; I'm not sure if this helped with getting table with a view or not. 

I ordered a cocktail, an Alcatraz Escape and it was comparable to a Mai Tai. It was very tasty. We started with crab cakes as an appetizer and they were delicious. My husband and I both ordered lobster tails. Oh my! These babies were huge! Again, scrumptious. We ended with tiramisu. When my husband suggested it for dessert, I was hesitant since we weren't at an Italian restaurant. No worries, it was wonderful just like the rest of the meal. 

Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. She provided her personal favorites from the menu. 

This restaurant was on the expensive side but we totally enjoyed our dinner. We also ordered the most expensive item on the menu (lobster tails $51) so you could get by with something not as expensive and I bet it would be equally delicious. My only negative comment is that it was a little loud. Highly recommend checking this restaurant out if you're in San Francisco.

9,Shelley V.,"We were staying in a hotel close to Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39. The concierge at our hotel gave us a coupon for Fog Harbor. We were doing a tour of Alcatraz that afternoon and decided we would eat at Fog Harbor that night. I added us to the wait list on yelp. It was a holiday weekend and the wait was over an hour.  

It's a large restaurant over looking the water. The tables are pretty close together but the view made up for it. They offered us regular menus, a seasonal menu, and a kids menu for our son. 

We decided to order the crab ceviche appetizer. It was good because it was different. It wasn't your typical citrusy and acidic ceviche. It was prepared with coconut milk so it was creamy. It was very flavorful and fresh. 

For our entrees, we split the cioppino and the mixed grill plate. The cioppino was very good. Spicy broth and lots of fresh seafood. The mixed grill had shrimp skewers, salmon, and cod. It had really good flavor and was fresh. It was served with mashed potatoes and green beans. 

For dessert, we ordered the apple walnut one. It was crunchy on top with oatmeal and had a scoop of ice cream on top. 

The service was incredible, the food was amazing, and the view was beautiful. Definitely check it out if you're looking for a nice dinner on the pier.

10,Abby S.,"Go for the ambiance and the fact that they utilize the Yelp waitlist. Stay for a cocktail and a tasty bread bowl.

Fisherman's Wharf is full of tourist traps - the good news is that Fog Harbor isn't one of 'em. Legit seafood, water views, linen tablecloths, etc. And they have ""world famous"" chowder. 

I dined with a group and most everyone didn't order the expected Cippino, chowder or, Crab Louie salad. So of course I had to! Dungenesd crab cocktail and a Caesar/bread bowl combo. Sometimes appetizers are the way to go. Though I wouldn't say the chowder was famous, it was good! Creamy and full of tasty fishy bits.

If you're stopping in for a drink and a bite, I'd recommend the Lemondrop martini, as it feels very SF and goes well with seafood.

11,Santi T.,"Craving fresh sourdough bread? Come to Fog Harbor Fish House and try their signature bread!

We spent the whole day in San Francisco and decided to have a sit-down meal at the Fisherman's Wharf Pier 39 to enjoy the atmosphere and a fresh seafood dinner. Initially, we used the Yelp app to put our name on the wait list, however, you know San Francisco traffic can be very unpredictable and made us tardy for our assigned time. When we arrived, the hostess put us back on the list again but since we were starving, I asked about the bar seating. It was opening seating and first come first serve. Luckily, there were enough seats for our party, and we sat at the bar with the attentive service from both bartenders. 

As we sat down, we were served fresh sourdough rolls with butter on the side. We immediately devoured the rolls as they were warm, straight out the oven with a light sourness and chewy texture to it. This was worth sitting in SF traffic.

We ordered the award-winning clam chowder in the fresh house baked sourdough bread bowl ($12) as our appetizer. The bowl was generous and included the top of the bread which we used to sink into the soup. The hot soup was creamy and very comforting. For one person, that could be a meal itself. We all shared it and agreed it was the highlight of our meal.

For our entrée, we ordered the Mixed Grill ($31) with grille salmon, Pacific cod, and shrimp, citrus beurre blanc sauce, sautéed vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes. The four shrimps were on a skewer and we used the beurre blanc sauce to dip each one. The two cuts of fish were moist and flavorful. The garlicky green beans were outstanding! We also ordered the Fish and Chips (too bready) and the Grilled Salmon with steamed broccoli. The servings for all the dishes were appropriate for the price and service was well maintained at the bar. 

We opted out for dessert elsewhere and were definitely full from our meal with the highlight being the sourdough bread and soup.

If you don't mind sitting side by side, I'd highly recommend putting your name on the waiting list but keep an eye out for the bar seating as they serve the exact same menu and it could be a quicker option.

They validate for one hour at the parking lot so bring your ticket.

Overall, Fog House Fish House was an excellent choice to fulfill our seafood craving in San Francisco.

12,Arnel S.,"You get what you pay for...and this place proves the wisdom of that adage.  From start to finish...this is a place I can proudly recommend others to try.  Of course, the place gets quite crowded, especially during holidays and weekends, so it's best to make reservations.  Really worth it to phone ahead.

The food was great!  Everything came well-cooked and well-flavoured.  It should be the same with other upscale seafood restaurants.  But what sets this place above the others is the speed and the quality of the service!  Our server (sorry I did not get her name) worked wonders.  Her recommendations were sound, her appeal was above-board, her speed was unbelievable, and her humour made the experience memorable!

My family and I came here during the Labour Day weekend, for a short San Francisco break to see the sights and sounds of the Bay.  And now, this restaurant has become a landmark for me and my family.  Highly recommended!

13,Michelle R.,"After riding the bay cruise ferry we headed straight to Fog Harbor for some lunch. This restaurant is a tad pricier than the other one we tried at the pier. We came here around 11ish. The wait was only about 10 mins and the restaurant was not that packed yet. 

For appetizer we decided to order the following dishes:

Blue cheese garlic bread  - This dish had fresh sourdough topped with blues cheese, herbs and garlic. I'm not a fan of blue cheese and this tasted ok. I ended up scraping all the blue cheese off the bread and it tasted better. 

Crispy Calamari - This dish has fried jalapeños and onions served with lemon aioli. This was yummy! 

Dungeness crab ceviche - This had coconut milk, jalapeño, cilantro, mango, fresh lime, tomato and toasted coconut with tortilla chips. This one tasted ok. The mixture of the crab and mango had a alright taste. This was only serviced with about 3-4 pieces of tortilla chips. 

For the main dish, I ended up ordering the Linguini & Clams. At $22, this dish had fresh clams, olive oil, tomatoes, garlic, white wine and butter topped with parmesan cheese. This dish serving is only good for one person. There is a ok amount of pasta in the dish and clams. I think that other restaurant gives you more. The bread that was in the dish was crunchy and hard and was quite spicy for my liking but over all the dish was good. 

Other dishes that we ordered are the pan-seared chicken breast. This had sautéed spinach, pearl onions, mushroom herb sauce and garlic mashed potatoes. We also ordered a bowl of their award winning clam chowder too. 

Overall, we all enjoyed the food we got and service was good.

14,Morlene C.,"Sure it's touristy, but on a nice day the views are pretty and the seafood is very fresh. My group was seated at a corner table by a huge window which offered us views of docked boats and the Golden Gate Bridge.

Their menu is quite extensive and hard to choose from. The mixed grill might be a good option for someone who is indecisive because it includes multiple types of seafood. I ordered the halibut special off the seasonal specials menu. It was a hefty portion of halibut and while it was fresh it was somewhat plain. I would've loved to douse it in some kind of chili oil, but I don't think they mess with that over here. I would've settled for sriracha, but I don't think they have that either. 

I did really enjoy a cup of their clam chowder, which they tout all over the menu and website that it's award winning. You know what though, it does taste award-winning, as there was plenty of clam meat in each bite. They really tried to upsell me on adding crab to the clam chowder, but I didn't bite.

Our server was attentive and helpful with helping us pick from their monstrous menu. Seems like a nice enough place to take visitors.

15,Jessica J.,"People aren't lying then they say seafood in San Fran is a must! I'm a big fish lover so I was eager to have some delicious dishes while in town for a few days.

My colleagues and I had a 5pm rez at Fog Harbor. A beautiful time of night to be on the pier and to be sat near the windows overlooking the water from inside the restaurant. We were placed at a big round table, and were quiet immediately greeted by our friendly server. 

Everyone put their drink orders in (a hard blackberry press for me!) before looking over the food menu. It genuinely took all of us so long to decide what we wanted to order because the menu is jam packed with options (both land and sea). I went for a cup of clam chowder as a start because it just felt right LOL. For my main: Ahi Tuna. Oh my goodness was I happy with my . It was seared ""rare"", and sesame seed crusted, with ginger soy glaze, wasabi aioli, stir fried vegetables and garlic jasmine rice... #YUM

No one else at the table had a single complaint and I'd say we all left pleasantly satisfied

16,Piyush C.,"This is a popular Pier 39 location for seafood and I had to give it a try. I went in here for a date and the location is what the fuss is all about. It's overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge and the California sea lions resting on the SF shoreline. You can watch the boats come and go at the dock for hours. I found it fascinating to sit by the window and recall fond memories.

They have a lot of choices for the menu but we decided to try Clam chowder soup and Assorted fish (Cioppino) clam, scallop, mussels and crab servings. First they brought the clam chowder and our server was a little slow to take our order, but place was very busy during Labor Day weekend. So I will give them that. A better server came to serve the main course.

Quality of soup was very good in my opinion but my date said they have tried better soup. I found the grilled fish to be fresh and the sauce on the salty side but they had a good variety of seafood and everything tasted great. We found that there was no clam meat in the broth/ sauce as promised. As for the price I don't think that it's worth paying so much money for medium sized portions. I think they are mainly charging for the service, cleanliness and location. But if your budget allows it please order more than two main entrees (for a couple) if you are really hungry.

I have to say that it's a very romantic spot and they have polite servers. Overall I was satisfied and I would like to try grilled fish next time.

Clam chowder was good and I enjoyed it as an appetizer.  We ordered the Seafood Platter for 2 and was not disappointed.  It was full of mussels, clams, crab legs, potatoes, shrimp, and topped off with a lobster tail.  It was loaded with butter and fresh garlic.  My only complaint was there was a bit too much butter on the platter.  By the time you got to the bottom of the seafood and potatoes, there seemed to be a lot of butter left.
We sat by the window and enjoyed the view of Alcatraz, the Golden Gate Bridge, Sea Lions, and several boats in the harbor.  Would visit again.

Sourdough rolls are warm and baked fresh in house, yum. Clam chowder...award winning? I have definitely had way better, even Boudin's is tastier. 

My lobster roll was bland bland bland. Had to douse it in tabasco, and the roll was too bready. The fries were good, but your typical frozen fries.

All the entrees - everything was underwhelming. Seemed to be missing a lot of seasoning hence flavor.

Again, for the view and service, everything was great on that end! Reservations can be made via Yelp!

Great plate of mixed seafood. Everythjng was fresh. The crab legs were good and the shrimp was spot on. If I could do it over, I would opt out for the garlic noodles or have them om the side. The garlic noodles were AOK but not great.

Shellfish Platter Overall 4 Stars
Garlic Noodle- 3 Stars
Lobster-4 Stars

The view was outstanding. You get a great view of Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge. You can sit back with a nice plate of food in a comfortable place with a great view..which makes me a fan of this place. They also have a full bar.

Parking sucks. However, if you park in the structure across the street, they validate for an hour. Set aside at least two hours for walking around and eating.

20,Monique H.,"I made reservations for dinner at Fog Harbor and they totally hooked us up with a table with a view, it was beautiful. 

To start, the sourdough was fresh and extra sour.  The same dough is used for the clam chowder bread bowls which is as good as everyone says.  It would have been just as delicious with out the crab meat on top but I added it because I love seafood. 


For the main course I ordered the Surf & Turf.  I was disappointed with the quality of the steak, it was not as tender as what I was expecting.  The lobster was fresh and cooked to perfection.  The mashed potatoes were undercooked.  Everything else from the cocktails to the service was on point and as a whole, it was quality dinning.

24,Monica B.,"On a recent business trip, I was looking for a place for seafood. I chose this place because of the reviews and I thought that the three other people I was dining with would enjoy it. Some of my friends made fun of me on Instagram for choosing a ""touristy"" place at Pier 39. Oh, well. The first meal we had when we arrived in the Bay Area was here and it was awesome! 

I'm a picky scallop eater so much so that I typically don't order it when I eat out. I'm often disappointed and think it's tragic to harm scallops by over- or under-cooking it. After reviewing the seasonal crab menu, I jumped it and ordered the seared scallop and crab risotto. It was prepared with tomatoes, parmesan cheese, cilantro pesto, and beurre blanc. The scallops were perfectly seared and cooked inside. I couldn't have asked for a better preparation! The surprise was that the crab risotto was also cooked perfectly! The texture and sweet, mild flavor of the crab with the rice...I'm in love!!!

My meal was perfect! It was a rather warm day and I paired it with ginger lemonade. This was no joke. There was actual ginger in the drink and it was fantastic!

Located on the upper level of Pier 39. There is a welcoming waiting area with the fireplace. The back wall of the restaurant has large windows so that you can see the beautiful View of the water and maybe even a sunset depending on what time you go.

I was eating alone so I was quickly offered a seat at the bar or a wait for a table was 20 to 30 and I went on a Friday evening about 7 PM. The restaurant was full so you might want reservations for a group.

29,Chris Z.,"My girlfriend and I flew into SFO and decided to check out fisherman's wharf after dropping off our stuff at the hotel. We wanted something not super fancy but a proper sit down restaurant, and we found this place with a super high rating. We got our reservation through yelp, and checked in to the restaurant on time. We were seated quickly. The restaurant was HUGE! There were just so many seats. 

We thought the ambiance was quite casual. There were large sheets of paper covering the table, like fast food restaurants. We got the calamari, the spaghetti, and the bread bowl clam chowder. 

The calamari came out first and it was huge. It tasted just alright; it wasn't as crispy as we had hoped. The clam chowder was pretty good with crab meat. The spaghetti was a bit tasteless and wasn't all that special. 

Then, as we asked to have our food packed up and got the bill, the waitress took our plate of calamari and a few pieces fell on the table. She picked them up with her hands, put them back on the plate, and says that it happens a lot. We were both shocked at how unsanitary that was, but were too in shock to say anything. We ended up throwing it away when we got home. The three dishes + tax + tip cost us more than $60, which was quite shocking too. We will probably not be returning and will instead be dining across the street at in n out.

32,Jim S.,"A good somewhat expensive place to get Dungeness Crab and Clam Chowder.  When a restaurant relies heavily on tourists the food and/or service is typically sub par but that wasn't necessarily the case here.  Our waiter, Justin, was excellent, the restaurant decor and setting is very nice and the food was prepared right and pretty good.  We had a table overlooking the water and it was a beautiful night.  The sour dough bread, Crab and clam chowder were excellent.   The clam chowder was the best I've ever had and is reason enough to go here.  However, outside of the those three items the menu and food was pretty much average (not bad just nothing special).  Dinner wasn't cheap but no more than expected for a place on the pier in SF. Overall I would recommend this place for a nice dinner out (perhaps while on vacation) but don't expect a ton of menu options.

This place has everything you would want or like for seafood, from raw oysters, seafood pasta, or even whole roasted Dungeness crab. The most famous item that I see everyone or what is on yelp is the seafood platter mix.

In addition to the delicious food here, this place is right next to the waterfront. With a delicious meal and view, there is not much more you can ask for. Waiters and servers are very well mannered and nice too. I would come back anytime for lunch. Have not yet come for dinner, but this is a place I am willing to come for a dinner date.

34,Mai N.,"The clam chowder was savory and delicious. I wished they had them in cans! 

The garlic crab was just okay. The crab was over cooked and had too much butter for me. It's been hours later and I'm still choking from the butter in my throat.

35,Yaeko M.,"It's a very popular restaurant in the fisherman's Wharf. 
I suggest to make a reservation if you come to have dinner here.
I went with group of 4 and shared the dishes. 
We had signature CLAM CHOWDER $7.5 cup, Crispy Calamari $16 , Salmon Salad $24, Pacific Sole $24, Cioppino$35.
All dishes are fresh and tasted very good. I love the clam shower and the grilled salmon salad.
I hoped to order more and taste more but we got so full. We couldn't try dessert.
I would love to come back and try different dishes. 

Ambiance: great
Food: great
Service: good
Price: reasonable

36,Tanusree M.,"This place was pretty good, but pricey (as expected for a restaurant on the pier). We ordered a few things - oysters, mussels with fries, scallops risotto. The oysters were fresh and delicious. The mussels were nice and tasty, the broth tasted delicious with the fries. The risotto left something to be desired. They only gave 4 scallops, I feel as though it should've at least come with 6. I felt like they could've given a bit more for an expensive dish. The risotto was okay, nothing special. 
Overall, the service was great and the food was okay.

37,Jennifer G.,"THE BEST CLAM CHOWDER HANDS DOWN. So good, had it on day 1 of my trip and had to come back before leaving the city for one more bowl! Decent wait times, take advantage of the yelp virtual wait-list! This restaurant is in the heart of the pier so you can do some sightseeing while your table is ready.  Food is top quality, super friendly servers who are on their A game on both of my visits. Menu has wide selection, plenty non- seafood options available if you don't like sea food. Extensive wine list. The views from every table are amazing. So nice to enjoy good food with a view. Restaurant is on the pricier side, but the food quality and ambiance are unbeatable in this area.

Food:
Salmon club salad with lemon vinaigrette and lemon aoli is excellent!
Award winning clam chowder-the best I've had in SF!
Sour dough bread- goooooooddddd
Mixed grill-pretty good even as leftover. 

I highly recommend this restaurant for some good seafood in the bay. Hands down.

39,Britt M.,"The HYPE is real. This place is magical. For one, it takes reservations which is key when traveling. I definitely suggest making a reservation as we went on a Tuesday night and it was packed. The food is excellent. My family had the clam chowder soup, mixed seafood dish, the fish and chips, and the crab cakes. All were delicious! The crab cakes are pretty spicy so if you're not into spice I would steer away from them. The view from the restaurant is also stunning. If you are able to get a spot against the window on the pier side the view is gorgeous. Also, be sure to go see the sea lions at the end of the pier before going to eat. They are Uber entertaining.

40,Jodeye H.,"We made a reservation via Yelp, and unfortunately our flight was delayed. We called to let the hostess know and she said she would just put a note. To our surprise, upon arrival, we were seated immediately with a great view! Server was prompt. We had the calamari as a starter -
So amazing! We then shared the clam chowder bowl, added crab. Not sure if the ""add crab"" takes away from how much they put in your bread bowl, but there could have been a little more chowder. Dirty Martinis were a great ending to our meal. Hubby & I were satisfied.

42,Roxie H.,"Located on Pier 39, it's a very busy restaurant that mostly attracts tourists. Reservations are recommended especially on weekends. However, the bar is almost always open and is open seating. 

Almost all of the tables have an amazing view of the bay, Alcatraz, and Golden Gate. I would give the restaurant itself five stars. 

The menu has an abundance of fresh seafood options, a rotating 'seasonal' menu, and some pastas along with their 'Award winning clam chowder.' 

The food itself is a 3.5. The sourdough rolls served prior to our meal were stale and difficult to eat. A table adjacent to us actually sent theirs back. The clam appetizer 'steamed with chorizo and corn' was interesting but not amazing. Half dozen oysters were fresh and cleaned nicely, which raised the score a bit, and the fried rock shrimp 'special' with asparagus was only ok. 

I would recommend drinks to accompany the view. Maybe something from their raw seafood section which they seem to do spot on.

43,Doug S.,"Stopped by for a pre-anniversary dinner on our last night in SanFran.  Stopped by around 3 and it was still busy.  We waited about 5 min for a seating at the window.   Windows are hot with sun, so take that into consideration (they will lower shade).   
Ordered a special app of fried shrimp and asparagus.  It was crunchy and delicious.  Like a lite tempora batter.  I had the panko halibut and my wife had the  cioppino.   My fish was perfectly done but the coating got soggy quickly.  I don't know how they would fix it.   The side dish was cold salad like mix.   It was supposed to be that way but it surprised me.  I enjoyed it as well. Nicely contrasting tastes from light fish.  My wife ate every bite of the cioppino, except one.   It was spicy and saucy.   It will have you licking your fingers and dipping bread.    Would recommend for dinner and or a special occasion.   
Only drawback of the whole experience is the closeness of the tables.   Barely enough room for the wait staff.

44,Mitchell M.,"Beyond disappointing. Waited over an hour to try this place out. It's obvious why it's in the ""touristy"" part of town. This was the worst meal I have had in years. Avoid this tourist trap. 

Service was awful, but the food was worse. Tried the Pesto Chicken Pasta and none of it was cooked correctly. Chicken was overdone and dry, onions were undercooked, pesto was drowning in olive oil. Extremely disappointing. It's as if nobody with a qualified palate has ever sampled the dish critically. The dish also came with some sort of green leaves, which I can assume were either sautéed spinach, or basil leaves. The execution was so poor, it was impossible to discern what they actually were. I understand that fresh basil is an expensive kitchen commodity, but the price of the plate should more than cover it. The pesto could also benefit from the use of pine nuts. 

Bread appetizer arrived cold and stale. The bakery across the street has amazing bread, why not use it as a supplier instead of the crusty rocks currently being used? They're supposedly baked fresh in house, but that certainly was not the case this evening. 

Server removed wine glasses from the table before even asking what we wanted to drink (you lost a sale of a bottle of wine because of it). I find that a tad..... presumptuous? Server had little to say, offered no input on the menu, and did not go over the drinks. He did, however, refill our waters. So there's that. 

Our plates and utensils were all dirty before we even touched them. Wine glasses were not polished and still dripping wet from the wash. I cannot believe the prices of the menu items for this abysmal level of service and food. 

Cioppino was nothing to write home about. Mediocre flavor. Tadich Grill is vastly superior in every way, both in food and service, and has a far better tasting cioppino (go to Tadich Grill over this place). Don't waste your time or money here. Horrendous ending to the day.

I'm sure this place is fine if you're not experienced with fine food, but it screams ""I'm average"" to the discerning customer. Find some flavor. 

Edit: forgot to mention, the food came out from the kitchen reasonably quickly (albeit, we only ordered soups and pastas), and that allowed us to leave sooner.

My qualifications: server, bartender, and barback in the fine dining industry in Los Angeles and San Diego for four years.

For the MGMT: you have too few servers and too many hosts. The servers were all inattentive and offered poor service because they have way too many tables at once. Meanwhile, the front of the house host staff was standing around aimlessly the majority of the time. Reassign and cross-train. Was obvious from the second we walked in. Focus on the kitchen FIRST though.

45,Kawai K.,"This is purely based on my visits (3) to the bar during their daily Happy Hour. It was a great experience. I sampled the oysters, calamari, and their clam chowder, with each being as good as the other. My favorite of the three may have been the calamari. The bartenders were also friendly and attentive. 

Quick note: If you happen to have a party of three or larger, I would imagine that you might be in for a bit of a wait. They were slammed each day that I was there. 

Tasty food, great service and a solid Happy Hour, which means that you should definitely give them a try.

46,Jasmine D.,"This place started off at 3 stars based on first impression- super busy touristy restaurant that took us at least 10 minutes for someone to notice us after being seated, even to get our drink orders. I was truly hesitant about the quality of the food here after realizing it was located in the heart of Fisherman's wharf. But to my pleasant surprise, the pricy food slightly exceeded our expectations. My foodie partner in crime, Natalie M., and I shared the famed clam chowder bowl and scallops and Dungeness crab risotto, both of which I would highly recommend. The sourdough bread is great too, and they refill it no charge. Our waitress tried to make up for neglecting us initially by throwing in a couple extra sourdough rolls to go..it helped. 

Good place overall, if you have patience to wait and fight through the crowds of tourists.

It had bacon in it and a good amount of clams (don't you hate when restaurants serve CLAM chowder and there are like two pieces in there?) and it was creamy and sooooo good with the sourdough bread bowl. 
It's good to share for two people.

We also got the baked oysters, and let me tell you, I prefer raw oysters over baked, but mmmmmmmm these were served on a bed of rock salt and the flavor and seasoning was on point! 

Fog Harbor was one of my best experiences while visiting San Francisco. We made a reservation one week out and prime dinner times were not available, but we still got a good time and waited a little more to sit at the window (so pretty)!

50,Wei-Chieh M.,"This place has delicious cioppino and clam chowder. Cioppino is the seafood stew originated from San Francisco and this was my first time trying and I loved it. Their cioppino was in red sauce and it had plenty of seafood including mussels, fish, clams, shellfish, crab, shrimps. The red sauce had a strong tomato and garlic taste and it was a little bit spicy, overall the taste was harmonious. The award winning clam chowder was creamy and the bread bowl was a sour dough bread that tasted better than the piece of garlic beard came with the cioppino. On top of the delicious seafood, the service here was great. Our server was nice and friendly. 

One tip to avoid the wait is to join the Yelp waitlist. We arrived a couple minutes before the designated check in time and they had our table ready very promptly.

51,Chris K.,"Disappointed is the kindest word I can describe my experience at the Fog Harbour. 
View was ok. Food was somewhat average for typical tourist restaurant. My experience was totally ruined when the bill came out. 

We set down and ordered platter for two for $ 79.00. We were thinking that the portion was on the heavy side. Service was below average considering waiter wasn't paying much attention. 

After the meal our waiter, Michael Kelly, gave us a bill worth $ 145.00. When I asked our waiter about the price, he told me that we ordered with lobster tail. And he said that it was a mistake. 

Presenting $ 79 menu and giving $ 145 bill sounds like a typical scam. Hope others will share the same experience soon.

52,Vivian C.,"THIS PLACE IS ACTUALLY GOOD. A tad expensive, but what can you expect from Pier 39. 

Ordered multiple things to share: cioppino, clam chowder, calamari, seafood penne, pacific sole, dungeness crab, salads and drinks. So much food. Love, love, love. 

- Award winning clam chowder was pretty good. They had bacon bits in there to make it extra fatty/delicious.
- Seafood penne and cioppino tasted way too similar imo. Probably shouldn't ordered both at the same time (while they were good), but same mix of seafood.
- We ordered so much other food that the sole didn't stand out as much. Still good though.

We had a nice view of the water too, so A+. Really enjoyed the meal, although noise level was on the higher to too-much side. 

Would definitely recommend for the area it's in, but probably a one time or ""only when guests visiting"" meal for me.

Shared a clam chowder in a sour dough bread bowl, that was AMAZING! I'd get that again in a minute! Service was top notch!! Our server made great recommendations on food & drinks & next stops. 
Wait time...I totally recommend ""checking in"" on yelp & then wandering about for a while. That worked out perfectly for us. We had a reservation for later but since we got in early, and were starving by that time, we used Yelp to check us in on our way so we didn't have to wait like others.

I came here on Monday for lunch with a friend and it was extremely packed. Thankfully, I made a reservation on Yelp so we were seated after about five minutes. Our waiter was extremely attentive and kind and made sure we had everything we needed, including the complimentary bread. The bread is delicious and comes out fresh! I ordered the pesto pasta, and my friend ordered some dish that had grilled shrimp, fish, mashed potatoes and green beans. We also ordered their chowder, which they are famous for. 

My pasta was delicious! It was full of flavor and cooked to perfection. The clam chowder was also one of the best I've ever had. It was savory and buttery and paired well with the bread. I tried my friends order and wasn't too fond of it however; the seafood tasted pretty bland.

It has a nice cream structure, with a quality and very tasty ingredients in it. We paid $16 for this soup and it definitely worth it. We also had Dungenes Crab Ceviche and my favorite appetizer ever - Ahi Tuna Ceviche. Both were good, but I still love Ahi Tuna more than Crab. They serve wine in two different options 5 oz or 8 oz, of course we got 8 oz of their house Sauvignon Blanc and that was decent for $13.

My dad suggested Fog harbor fish house for the views and excellent food. Definitely should listen to my dad more as this was exactly the dining experience I wanted for this occasion. 

We had the pleasure of having Mel as our waiter who made the best recommendations and the entire experience at Fog Harbor Fish House exceptional. He was very attentive to our table and made the whole evening feel like a special occasion- which it was:) 

We started with the award winning clam chowder which was soo creamy and delicious! 

The real winner was the scallop and crab risotto which was perfectly prepared. The scallops were perfectly seared and made the dish absolutely amazing. 

Mel made this a 5 star review for me as he brought out a congratulatory desert for my friends and I to share. That special touch just showed how he really cared about the whole dining experience and made us feel so special for our accomplishment!

The beautiful views provided by the location of the restaurant are unbeatable, the fresh eats keep you wanting more and the service is exceptional. Today we had the pleasure of having Dane as our waiter, he was kind and attentive despite the increasing hustle and bustle of the establishment. 

My husband and I enjoyed their award winning clam chowder (delicious), house salad (add bleu cheese), baked oysters (trying something new - they were different, I added a couple to my salad), baked garlic cheese toast (rich & yummy), whole garlic crab. I made a special request to have my crab pre-pulled from the shell (this was a menu option a couple of years ago for an additional charge), my request was granted without any hesitation and made an already great experience even more enjoyable.

59,Gabrielle Z.,"Great view of the harbor, famous seals, and Alcatraz in the bustling Wharf area. For a nice-casual dining spot, this is great for a group looking to eat some fresh seafood. Service is great, seafood is good.

For an appetizer, I would 100% recommend their famous clam chowder -- and if they are offering it being topped with fresh crab, take that offer...it really is a game changer! Also don't turn down the sourdough rolls -- they're perfectly crunchy on the outside and warm and fluffy on the inside. The baked oysters are really small, so not something I'd recommend getting. 

For main dishes, I'd recommend the Linguine & Clams and the Fresh Mix (cod, salmon, and shrimp). The seafood is fresh tasting and the sauces on the dishes are really tasty. Overall, happy and full!

I appreciated the menu picture book that our waiter offered us to give us a better idea of the food. Baked oysters were cheesy and good. Chicken penne was alright and my friend didn't finish her food. Mixed greens were your typical fresh salad.

66,Ploy N.,"Had a divine dinner with my family last night and I really meant it when I said that the meal was DIVINE; we really splurged on this meal .

On the second floor of Pier 39, the restaurant overlooks the waterfront area. Soft afternoon light settled on the white table cloth and plates, giving off a warm yet fancy atmosphere. 

We ordered the Clam Chowder Bowl with Crab, the Shellfish Platter with Lobster Tail (for one person), and the Mixed Grill for the four of us.

The Clam Chowder came first with a plate of baguette rolls and butter. The place claimed that their chowder is an award-wining one. Naturally, I was skeptical and almost stopped my mum from ordering, but, boy, I was very wrong. Unlike other chowders I've had, the chowder here was perfectly balance. It was creamy, but not too buttery, and had just the right amount of salt. Not to mention, the generous amount of crab and clam chunks that were in it! I really loved dipping the baguette into the chowder; the baguette itself was also very delicious. It was crispy on the outside and warm and pillowy on the inside. Just the bread and butter can take you places.

Next was the Shellfish Platter. It certainly was a show-stopping dish. It came with a pile of boiled and grilled clams, mussels, shrimps, dungess crabs, and the extra lobster tail. Everything was heftily drowsed in garlic, butter, and oil - what could go wrong. Every seafood on the dish was fresh and perfectly cooked. I don't know how they do it, but they did! The fingerling potatos were roasted well and soso flavorful. 

The Mixed Grill consisted of grilled shrimps, salmon filet, and cod filet, with a side of stir-fried string beans and garlic mash potato. The seafood was good; my favorite was the salmon, which had a distinct salinity to it that I really enjoyed. But what really got me were the string beans!! There was a delicious wok smokiness to them that made it impossible for me to stop going back for more.

Again, I had a divine meal here last night and would definitely reccommend anyone in the area to come check this amazing place out.

We got the crab cocktail and calamari for the starter. I highly recommend the crab cocktail. It was shredded crab and it was delicious. Calamari was ok. 

So I got the two lobster tails and it was $58. 
I thought two was perfect because it's my favorite, however they were extremely!!!! Salty, didn't taste good at all. I told the sever and also informed her I didn't wanna wait another 20 minutes for food.

70,Cassandra M.,"One of must try iconic dishes on San Francisco are the seafood cioppino and the clam chowder. Many places will have it but must try for the best in town. Last time, this place had a long line-up so this time I came 10min after opening to grab the best seat by the window.

One note I'll like to mention was that I arrived as a solo dinner. I was greeted by a very unwelcoming tone.  The hostess asked "" Hello....may I help you..??"" in a way that I don't belong there and was there to give her hassle. It was when I replied ""Do you take a table for one?"" was when she realized I was there to dine in. I will appreciate if she had greeted me more pleasantly and politely, just a simply, ""Good Day Madam, would you like a table for one?"" Or ""Hello, for one?"" will be nice. That's one star gone! So The 4-stars are for the food and waiter.

Ambience: The dining area is very spacious and surrounded by large glass window looking out the fisherwharf bay. If you get a seat by the window, you get a good view of the sea lions sun bathing and a fabulous view of the whole Alcatraz island. 

Clam Chowder: It is indeed award winning soup! The base was very creamy and thicken, not too salty. It was filled with chunky clam meats which is delightful as many other clam chowder versions at other restaurants aren't that generous. The sourdough bread gives a perfect touch to complete the taste. 

Seafood Cioppino: First off, the seafood varieties are very very fresh. The dish had crabs, clams, mussels, scallops and fish; being a picky fish eater, the fish meat in this dish had no strong after taste but full of sweetness and flaky texture. The tomato base broth has a thick texture with chucky tomatoes bites and has just a tad of heat to compliment the freshness of the seafood. Overall a truely satisfying dish for seafood lovers.

When she finally brought me my water, she brought me some sourdough bread rolls that were stale. 

I ordered clam chowder with the crab which was pretty darn good. I ordered the fried combo which was not good. The bottom of the dish that it was served in had a 1/4 inch layer of grease. The piece of fried cod that was served with it had more batter than fish. Needless to say I had a stomach ache when I left, probably from the thick layer of grease that was coating my stomach. 

Pros:
The view from the dining area was nice.. and the chowder was good. 

Cons:
Service was bad, rolls bad and the fried combo was bad.

74,Techrin H.,"This is probably one of the tastiest places! I was very impressed how it's in a tourist area and the food and service is excellent! The best view too! 
We had almost everything on the menu! The baked oysters are to die for! The best I've ever tasted! The dungeons crab is very tasty just messy! The deserts are amazing. We had 3!! The chocolate with raspberry and banana chocolate were my favorite. The house Cab also very tasty and great value. For sure will come back and have the lobster sandwich

75,Elias S.,"Came here for the clam chowder after hearing that's is a must try. 
Got it with some crap meat added for $7 extra and honestly it's not worth it as you get an ounce or two for that 7 dollars.  The chowder itself isn't very memorable to be honest.  Still a food place to visit for the atmosphere. 
Probably won't be back here.

Food wise was also great. We got the garlic crab, scallop risotto and the famous clam chowder. The portion was decent and in good taste. Seafood was very fresh. 
I used the app the wait in the line 20 mins ahead. When I arrived here I only waited about 5 mins.
The price is a little bit high... but it's the wharf and the service definitely worth it!

78,Michi S.,"We arrived around 2:15pm on a Saturday and got seated 45 minutes later. I was a bit skeptical being in the middle of all the touristy shops but we were willing to take a risk. 

It was definitely crowded so we were surprised to be seated by the window on a beautiful sunny day! Despite the fact that we already had a late lunch, we each wanted a bowl of award-winning clam chowder with crab and drinks. Thankfully, our waiter graciously took our small order without pushing for us to order more. We scarfed down the delicious chowder and took our time sipping on our drinks. We were so full so couldn't get anything else but would love to give it a try next time we get a chance to visit SF again!

79,Doreen M.,"They gave us an amazing table!  Right by the window!  Came to have seafood!  Got the soup in a bowl and they gave us extra and also got the seafood tower (cold) to share.  They also give you free bread.  Loved all the food.  Did not explore the pier/other biz nearby, but you can certainly make an afternoon out of this place for sure, if not a whole day.  There is an aquarium a couple doors down and you can see seals basking int he sun.  The place is huge and busy.  We did have an RSVP.  Service was friendly and nice.  They also would accommodate huge groups of 8-10 etc.

80,Keizzel C.,"Located at Pier 39, I'll be honest and say this spot is a HUUUUGE tourist restaurant, but living in the Bay Area I have to admit that Fog harbor is a great spot to grab lunch with a view. Known for their whole Dungeness crabs (steamed, cracked, garlic, chili, etc.) definitely come now since they're in season. 

Knowing how busy this place can get I recommend making a reservation before hand. We made a reservation the day of for 2 people at 12:30PM with no issue. If you forget to make a reservation beforehand they do let you add yourself to their waitlist on Yelp. 

If you decide to come here meals will cost you at ~$20+ but their clam chowder is only $9 for a bowl, $11 in a bread bowl, and $18 to top it with crab. Great option to get on a gloomy day! I also ordered their fish & chips ($19) and was satisfied with the dish. For $19 I think the portions were a great size and I definitely felt stuffed after. The meal comes with 3 large pieces of beer battered fish that has a crispy outside, side of coleslaw, and nicely thin cut/crisp french fries. The server also brought over some malted vinegar to top if off with. 

*They also serve complimentary bread/butter that they bake fresh every day 

For being such a busy place I liked how they had enough servers to handle the lunch rush and the servers were attentive enough but let you have your space during your meal. 

Overall Fog Harbor is a solid spot to crab any of your seafood needs (fried calamari, clam chowder, whole crab, pasta, and sandwiches) with great views of Alcatraz and the sea lions.

81,Michelle D.,"Ohhhhhh boy. This is a good one!

After looking through some reviews for some good seafood, we decided on Fog Harbor. We got there and literally had to wait 2 minutes to be seated, which was nice because it was lunch time. The place was nicely decorated and I almost felt like I was on a boat. 

The waiter we had was so on-point. He was friendly, explained the menu and make excellent recommendations, and he was extremely attentive. We were seated right by the window and had a great view of the bay.  

We started off with the award-winning clam chowder, which definitely lived up to our expectations. It's a MUST. It was Dungeness crab season, so we both had to crack one of those big boys open. They were DELISH. I'm glad they bibbed us and provided gloves, because it was def a bit of a messy experience, lol. I also got to try a non-alcoholic wine soda, which was surprisingly pleasant. Tasty and not too sweet, which is how I like my wine. 

Highly recommended if you're in the Wharf and want some fresh grub that will not disappoint. 5/5 with decor, service, and most importantly food!

82,Priscilla Z.,"Very busy location, and they asked for all party members to be present in order to be seated. We had a bigger group of 6 people. We missed one guy, who was late for 30 min, but it was nice that the host let us in. Maybe because we had our reservation early like 5pm. there were a lot of people waiting outside. Definitely have a reservation before you go.

I only remember we got some crab cake, which was done perfectly. Crunchy and yet you can taste the real crab meat. I also love my dish of the sole. It was flavorful and well done.

Their view is great if you get seat at the window. 

I would recommend for a group dinner.

85,Brenda L.,"I came to FHFH for a birthday and used Yelp's waitlist feature to put myself on the waitlist ahead of time. I am really glad I did because I noticed the folks that came immediately after me had an hour wait. I was seated shortly upon checking-in. The interior is classic looking with a great view of the water. I tried a seafood platter that came with shrimp, sausage, crab, mussels and clam. I also tried the award-winning clam chowder, and their fish special of the day. I opted for the clam chowder in a regular bowl rather than the bread bowl. It had a great flavor to it and was definitely one of the best clam chowders I have had. I like that their menu had a lot of photos. For the dessert ""menu,"" they bring out a giant platter with the desserts themselves that act as models for you to choose from. I tried a bread pudding and tiramisu. The tiramisu was spectacular and was something I'd definitely order again. The seafood tasted fresh. I think I would have preferred the cold/iced seafood platter over the hot one that I got. This place is located on the super popular Pier 39. There's a parking lot across the street where you can pay to park. Our server was quick and efficient. He took our orders without paper or pen. This is a great location for a special occasion. It is often very crowded so reservations would be a great idea.

We ordered the Soup and Salad combo, Shellfish platter, Fish and Chips, and whole Garlic crab with roasted herbs. The only dish that I had any problems with was the Fish and Chips. It was too oily and the crust was super thick. It felt off and really disturbing in my mouth. A suggestion is to have more utensils for cracking open the crab and lobster, but everything was good nevertheless. It's apparently crab season and they're picked from the bay morning of!

Thanks Jimmy our server for the hospitality.

88,W. John R.,"Visiting San Francisco for business for a couple of days and wanted the Wharf experience, even though it was cold, raining, and we worked long hours so the view was just dark and dreary. Stopped into Fog Harbor based on Yelp reviews and a magazine recommendation.

The entire group got the Garlic Roasted Whole Dungeness Crab. The crab was fantastic, with a nice presentation. The service was excellent, and the location (despite the weather and late-night arrival) was perfect for a business tourist wanting a memorable San Francisco meal. I especially appreciated that the waiter treated our wine bottles with care, chilled by the bottle at the table and poured for us rather than brought out warm by the glass.

My only complaint may be an unwarranted one given that I ordered whole dungeness crab and it's a dish I'm not used to ordering. There was enough butter/grease on the plate that I could tip the plate and dump out a cup of it. I love that the dish was buttery, and appreciated the drawn butter in a cup on the side (and dunked my succulent crab meat in it), but the potatoes, the green beans; everything was drenched in buttery grease. A light coating should have sufficed, but I'm not joking when I say that my plate had a pool of it underneath all the food. My stomach didn't feel all that great for about 24 hours after my meal - kind of the same feeling I have after eating movie theater popcorn where the butter was a bit heavy handed. I am a butter and garlic glutton, but this was too much even for me.

I would definitely recommend a stop into Fog Harbor for anyone visiting San Francisco. The sea lions aren't all that far away, either, and the boardwalk shopping (although it was all closed when we showed up) looks really fun.

89,Brian C.,"Visiting from Chicago. Relied on Yelp recommendations to find Fog Harbor Fish House. Reservation made for 5PM even a week in advance was a good sign for business. The restaurant was packed by the time we arrived at 450 PM.

Seated by the windows with a perfect ocean view on a sunny Saturday.

Cocktail shrimps were fresh and meaty. Sourdough bread was warm and soft.

Clam chowder was clammy with generous portions of clam meat.

Lazy cippino had fresh seafood (deshelled crabmeat, mussels, clams, shrimps) in a scrumptous broth with a toasted garlic bread to soak up all the juices.

Apple crisp was crispy at the top with warm and gooey apple slices at the bottom, topped with vanilla ice cream.

All in all, not ashamed to be tourists at a tourist spot with the best seafood and the best view to offer.

Extra shoutout to our server Jane. She was welcoming, kind, and with a positive attitude. She took care of our table and took pictures for us with a smile. Felt bad she got stiffed with a dingy tip by our neighbor table who appeared to be foreign visitors. She deserved all the tip and praise from her manager.

The men's bathroom was closed temporarily for cleaning during dinner hours, perhaps due to an ""incident.""

92,Randy M.,"It's difficult to write a review when a meal puts your brain in the fog and leaves you at a lost for words. This establishment prepares food that turns words like tasty, delicious and mouth watering into dumb cliches. 

Fog Harbor literally made my sense of taste fire on all cylinders. I enjoyed every bite of my food and had to resist the temptation of using my fingers to dip into the remaining saucy residue left over on the plate.

A full bar awaits those who desire to wet their whistles with perfectly crafted cocktails that can create a fog over the bay on a clear day, or sunshine through the rain. 

I feel like I'm rambling here. So let me spare you from a lengthy review filled with meaningless cliches. Meaningless because as I stated earlier, the food and service served up at this establishment goes beyond what words can describe.

97,Salma A.,"One of the best Fish houses I have ever been to! 
I made reservations on Yelp and under ""special requests"" I mentioned it was my husband's birthday. 

We came a little earlier from the reservation time and the table was not ready. So we sad at the bar and order some drinks while waiting. I had an ""Alcatraz Escape"" a rum cocktail similar to a rum runner and my husband got the ""Patron Margarita.""

The restaurant has a beautiful view and is located on Pier 39 on a second floor. The host took us to our table at our reservation time. She was friendly and polite. 

The menu has appetizers, seafood, salads, pasta, and steaks. I saw they have an ""Award winning clam chowder"" so we had to try it! We got two cups and some calamari as starters. The clam chowder was amazing! Really good and unique. The calamari was delicious as well; big serving. 

We had a bottle of Viognier with the appetizers and we ordered the ""Seared scallops with Crab risotto"" for me and the ""Garlic roasted Crab"" for my husband. Our server also brought us two delicious bread buns. They were warm and delicious! 

The food came out promptly and everything was beyond my expectations. My food was just fantastic! The scallops were a little too small but they were cooked perfectly and the crab risotto was the best! It had so much crab! The roasted crab was great as well it came with fingerling potatoes. Excellent. 

As we finish our meal I was a little disappointed because there was no sign of dessert or anybody coming to sign happy birthday to my husband. So we decided to order a ""Tiramisú"" I have no problem with paying off the dessert or anything but since I put it in the reservation I thought they would show some type of appreciation. I had some birthday candles on my purse (luckily!) So I asked our waitress for a lighter so that I could sign happy birthday. She cane and wish a happy birthday and smile and when she brought the bill they gave us the dessert for free. I know it was not her fault. Whoever check the reservation didn't inform her. 

Overall, I love the food and the restaurant. I give them 4.4 stars and definitely looking forward to come back and try more delicious food.

First off their service is top notch even when they are packed and I've been here for both. We came during the evening hour dinner rush and still did not have to wait too long, 20 minutes.

I ordered my favorite dish. Clam chowder with Dungeness crab in the sourdough bread bowl of course. Let me tell you I'd make the 8 plus hour drive to arrive here each day just to eat this dish! If only I were not just a mere human, I would no hesitation. That's how good their clam chowder and sourdough bread is!

How can a dish look so perfectly seasoned and taste so bland. I'm a salt person. I add salt to a lot of food because well I like it. ‍ I almost rarely have to add it to food priced north of $30 because the dish is most likely going to come with the right amount of flavoring. The mixed grilled comes with salmon, cod and shrimp. Only the shrimp packed a flavorful punch. Just kind of disappointed. It sucks because I wanted to like the place.

We generally stay away from Pier 39 because we've been a thousand times. But with the kids we thought it would be fun to hit the pier. Searched around on Yelp and found this spot. Had good reviews and a good kids menu. Drawback on a Saturday night will always be the wait time. We reserved ahead and got right in. Our server Jeremy was super friendly. Not just the BS friendly but legit made conversation and chatted it up with us about fantasy football. Bravo to him for knowing some Falcons players. Friendly, attentive and interactive with the kiddos! The food- it was actually hella good. I was skeptical because it's a touristy restaurant in one of THE most touristy places in the city but it didn't disappoint. My husband had the skirt steak- who am I kidding- I had his skirt steak too because it was that yummy. I did the crab cakes which were perfect- and I'm a picky little B when it comes to crab cakes. Kiddos had chowder, grilled shrimp and chicken strips (chicken strips kid is mine ). We also ordered the blue cheese garlic bread and holy smokes that was so good!

The atmosphere, the view (omg the view), the incredible food, and the service never gets old. I come here at least a couple of times a month. The last time I was here on Thursday, we had Adam who was super friendly and helpful! I ordered the usual Mix Grill which is super juicy and just divine. It's also decent priced for the quality of taste. 

I can't say how amazing the service is here. I've never once come across a rude server. In fact, they're always so upbeat, smiling and attentive despite the rush. I was here for my birthday on the 4th and the entire staff (especially Asia) made it worthwhile. They were the reason why this was my best birthday ever! Sang me happy birthday too which was expected lol. 

Shoutout to Bob the manager. Always comes to greet all the customers which you don't typically see at nice places. I can't forget Rafael! They both embody what amazing, beyond amazing customer service should be. This restaurant is lucky to have Rafael. Heck, any place would be lucky to have Rafael. He's always friendly, kind, and provides superb service which makes people want to come back!

106,Jessica S.,"Dinner fail. We did want to like this place, but there was just too much wrong to make it right.

I put our name on the waiting list before we even left our hotel, and we got down to the general area well before the anticipated arrival time. We were a bit far away when I got the text message letting us know our table was ready, but we hustled over to check in with the hostess.

When we checked in, the hostess claimed to not have my name on the list and told us the wait time was over 50 minutes. I told her I'd been texted that our table was ready. She asked for my name and phone number - twice - and made a big deal out of going through the computer and talking to another employee. The second employee finally ""found"" our name on the waiting list, and told the hostess we were texted to arrive. The hostess made it a point to glare at me and say, ""When we text you, we expect you to arrive immediately."" 

I replied, ""Look, if you don't have a table for us, we're fine going elsewhere"" and started to walk away. She was all smiles and welcoming after that, but it definitely left a sour taste in my mouth.

The girl that brought us back to our table did apologize for the ""reception"", but really, if you know you have a jerk like that working for you, do you really want to make her the first person your guests encounter? Our waiter was friendly, at least, and made it a point to welcome us and discuss the menu and their specials for the day. 
Our table was right next to a window, so we had a nice view of the bay and Fisherman's Wharf below. 

We got an order of calamari to share, and I went with a cup of their (""world famous"") clam chowder and the Ahi Tuna Poke for my meal. My husband ordered the Lobster Roll because he's still kicking himself for not having one the last time we were in Boston.

The calamari and a basket of sourdough bread rolls came out at about the same time. The calamari was good, but it also came with deep-fried jalapenos (the second time in San Francisco that a restaurant served jalapenos with their calamari. Odd.) It was served with a standard tartar sauce, nothing exceptional.

The clam chowder was good - creamy with lots of chunks of clam and potato. They say it's award-winning (The Best in San Francisco). The poke wasn't my favorite. They served it on a bed of diced mango, which overpowered the flavor of the fish. It also only came with four small wonton crisps, which wasn't enough for the plate.

My husband was similarly underwhelmed by his lobster roll. At $27 a pop, he was expecting an explosion of lobster. And, to be fair, when it landed in front of him, it did look quite impressive. But it was all smoke and mirrors, as the brioche bun they used for bread was cut in a way so that the lobster sat on top while looking as though there was a whole lot more on the inside.

With all the wonderful restaurants in San Francisco, I just wouldn't come back.

107,Anna H.,"This place has definitely lived up to the hype on their clam chowder - one of the best I've had. Honestly, I think it's better than Pike's place clam chowder in Seattle. We had the one with the lobster on top and that was phenomenal- fresh tasting lobster with that creamy, thick broth, and tender clams. Our server was super nice too, he took time with us to give us recommendations and even saved us some money because originally we were going to get the clam chowder bread bowl but he told us the bottomless bread is the same type and we could just use that! We also ordered the mussels and penne, crab, and a seafood medley with lobster, scallops and I think more crab mixed with a yummy red sauce. 

And we were celebrating my husband's birthday that weekend - they did not hesitate to offer us one of their desserts on the menu for free.

We ordered the new england clam chowder bread bowl, salmon, dungeness crab civiche, and the jumbo crab scallop and crab risotto. 

New england clam chowder - Pretty good clam chowder. The bread bowl was not very good.

Dungeness Crab Civiche - So good. Probably my favorite dish that I tried. Lots of crab chunks, good amount of citrus, and the chips were really good!

Jumbo crab scallop - Tastes pretty good but way too oily. It was swimming in oil.

Salmon - Cooked perfectly. Good amount of crisp. Way too much oil on the plate. Also swimming in oil.

Our waiter was very polite and friendly.

110,Charles N.,"Usually most pier restaurants are overpriced and crowded, with mediocre foods. This restaurant has it all: a beautiful view of the bay and Golden Gate Bridge, fresh seafood, and excellent menu. Make sure to use Yelp to reserve your spots ahead of time to avoid the long wait. Here's what we ordered.

Crab ceviche. Other Yelp reviews praised this as a must order dish. It's great, but it's not the best. There's a lot of crab meat, but there's way the onions don't bring out the taste.

New England Clam Chowder. Excellent. Not too creamy, plenty of clam meat. Tastes just right.

Fish and Chips. I had better up in Seattle. It's decent, but not worth the full price. If possible, just order the kid's menu fish and chips and you save some money. The major difference is an extra fried fish piece and some coleslaw. Save your $11.

Steamed clams. Excellent! The sauce is a bit different. They flavored it with a Cajun twist. It's not your typical white wine sauce. I love it!

Salmon. Wow, I usually don't like salmon but the way they cooked it here, it's so amazing! It's grilled and seasoned to perfection. The light sauce adds a lot of flavors.

Bread and Butter. The bread was fresh and warm. The butter simply melts on the bread.  Be careful not to fill your appetite with bread while you're waiting for your food.

Sliders. Okay, nothing to brag about. I would skip it next time around.

Overall, I would come back here again. There's a lot more amazing selections we didn't have a chance to order. Maybe next time.

112,Anna G.,"I got the sense walking up the steps..
 but this place is super touristy and therefore overpriced and subpar seafood. The hyped up award winning chowder and sourdough was bland and the oysters were not that fresh. Overall disappointed and def not coming back.

Only pro is that the service staff were great!

113,Yizhou J.,"One of the best seafood restaurants we've been to. The wait will be more than an hr but the nice thing about it is you can simply join the waiting list through yelp and see where your position is while having some fun at the pier 39. The scallops and crab risotto was our favorite and like my 15 yr old son put it, we can eat this thing over and over again! The clam chowder is very tasty but not salty- probably the best we've ever had. The garlic roasted Dungeness crab was a great choice as well.   Highly recommend for anyone who happens to be visiting the piers and the fisherman's dwarf!

Their calamari is crunchy and perfectly cooked every time. The seafood platter is a real seafood platter with everything on it. Lobster, shrimp, mussels, clams and crab. Everything so fresh and so good. The scallop and crab risotto is really good too.

116,Patricia A.,"Fog Harbor Fish House is located on pier 39. It is conveniently located near the entrance of the pier. After a long day of sightseeing and shopping you can rest your feet and enjoy the view of the bay from the Fog Harbor Fish House. You can enjoy a glass of wine or choose from a verity of specialty drinks. You can dine on sea food, steaks, and or both if you really feeling hungry.

Waiter and service was good no complaints whatsoever there! 

The food, it was pretty pricey but reasonable. I ordered the fish n chips and came with coleslaw. My partner ordered the special pasta of the day. And both were pretty good! I would try to come on an empty stomach because the food is pretty decent-big in portion size. 

This is definitely a place to come check out and impress your friends or family visiting in town! Loved it. And would come back for atmosphere and try other things, but not a lot just because it is pricey.

119,Honey C.,"I love this restaurant. We always go here when we visit Pier 39. They consistently serve delicious food. I always get the clam chowder served in the sourdough bread bowl with crab on top and it's delicious. My husband got the crab risotto with scallops, and it was very good as well. I don't even like scallops, but I liked what he ordered. Best scallops I've tasted, not over cooked so not rubbery, and the crab risotto was amazing too. 

The crab tater tots was just tater tots with crab on top and spicy aioli. It was good but not as great as the clam chowder and scallops with crab risotto.

The Chardonnay Vignette wine country soda, and the Strawberry basil nojito drink were so good too, especially if you love seltzer.

They have a good kids' meal and my kids enjoyed and finished theirs, including their ice cream sundae. The chocolate bread pudding was mediocre but I still gave this place a 5-star because everything else is delicious.

The Alcatraz escape is a beautiful, tropical looking cocktail that tastes even more tropical than it looks. Service was solid.

A nice grilled filet atop a bed of spinach, in a moat of pumpkin curry (not spicy) and cubed sweet potato bites.

Still our favorite place to dine in Pier 39! Look for it upstairs just beyond the front entrance to the pier!

133,Cassie C.,"I ate here yesterday as my first meal ever in San Francisco and I was definitely not disappointed!

I came at happy hour time (around 4pm) and so I got to take part of some happy hour specials while sitting at the bar. I came here for the sourdough bread bowl of clam chowder, and probably would've been fine with just that - but I couldn't pass up the fried lemon calamari on the happy hour menu for $7, and was very happy that I got that as well! (And some wine, of course).

The calamari had a great light, flavorful and crispy breading, and a delicious dipping sauce. There were also some fried onions and jalapeños mixed in with the calamari, which added to the flavor. I absolutely loved it.

The bread bowl met my expectations as well - they bake bread on premise and you could tell it is fresh and tasted amazing. The chowder was great as well; good chunks of clam and great flavor. I ate way too much and almost finished the entire thing. I was happily stuffed by the end of my meal!

Besides the amazing food, there is also great service and a beautiful view of the wharf. The bartenders were very attentive and I was never wanting for anything.

Another note: My phone was dying while I was there and I asked if they had a charger I could use, and they actually have a portable charger for patrons! That's the first time I've ever seen that. It was very appreciated and convenient. That was a great touch that the restaurant has.

I decided to eat here because of the great yelp reputation, and I can see why they have it. If I lived here, I would definitely frequent this place!

2. 2 orders of Fried fish combo: it has fish, calimari, and shrimp. Good for sharing
3. Several calm chowders: it is awarded as best clam chowder is SF.
4. Chicken Pasta: standard and good.

Total price is $256 including tips.

136,Soo H.,"Great view of the sunset from the dining room.  Dinner started with fresh sourdough bread.  They buy the dough from Boudin and bake a batch hourly.  The outside is crispy while the inside is fluffy.  There was a strong sour flavor.  I ordered the mixed grill plate.  French fries were crunchy and had a nice potato flavor.  Shrimp were plump, juicy, with a strong bay seasoning flavor.  I liked the shrimp.  Cod was grilled with a slightly spicier seasoning.  I liked this dish but the mild flavor and the cod was hidden by the seasoning.  Salmon was grilled with a seasoning that had a sweet component.  I loved the interplay between the savory salmon and the sweet flavor from the dry rub.

Vanilla creme brûlée had a mixture of sweet flavors from the crunchy crust and the creme under the crust.  I loved the vanilla flavor.  This dessert is big enough to share and I did but I could eat the whole thing myself.  

Service was attentive but rushed as we arrived during the dinner rush on Saturday night.  There is an air of mystery with each visit.  You never know what fresh seafood will be available.  I enjoy relaxing in a comfy booth watching the sun set on the bay after a long day of tourist activities.

138,Christine H.,"This review is for the views and their award-winning Clam Chowder (which was voted first place in a Fisherman's Wharf contest...means a lot since there are numerous clam chowder spots here):

-The views are great here (you can see Alcatraz, the bridge, etc).
-The service is pleasant, efficient, and professional.
-The clam chowder and sourdough bread are delicious! Plus, it was only $10ish for a decent-sized bowl of clam chowder...totally worth it (considering that this is a pretty high-end place with a super nice view).

Clam Chowder details: lots of clam, lots of veggies, and a perfectly warm and seasoned chowder...with a toasted and heavenly piece of sourdough bread...enuf...said.

Note: It's probably wise to make a reservation. Also, they have this automatic SF surcharge (I forgot what it was for)...

They DO have chargers available for you that you can charge your phone at the table but.. *DONT FORGET TO GIVE THE CHARGING PORT BACK TO THE STAFF* Hahah, we almost had a heart attack seeing the bill $1000 more than what anticipated because I forgot to give the charger back.. but man, that was a great way for a restaurant to get those things back! 

Overall, found this place on Yelp and saw nothing but great things on it. We weren't too hungry so we just got 2 appetizers and an entree and it was perfect for 3 people to share.. The dessert menu was omg.. so cool but def an incredible way for them to be able to sell the dessert because our waiter brought out a tray with ALL of them on it and man --how can you say no when they ALL look so good..

That's pretty much the only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5.

The clam chowder here was so amazing! It was creamy with pieces of clams and potato and I wanted to lick the bowl.

Scallop, crab, and clam risotto was pretty tasty at first bite but once I had a bite of the seafood penne pasta it was like move over risotto. Red sauce  better than white sauce FTW. The seafood on the penne pasta was cooked to perfection and I found myself dipping into this dish more than my own. The risotto I thought needed to be  cooked more. It wasn't as creamy as I prefer risotto to be. It was still good but I'd get the penne pasta next time.

The tiramisu was delish. It was a bit more chocolatey but still light with hints of expresso. Service was great and I could see myself coming back for more clam chowder.

The Red Chili Garlic Shrimp needed heat, I was disappointed the only hot sauce they had was Tobasco, I wish they had Crystals!
The Cioppino was enough to share and they didn't charge extra to split. 
My favorite and I could have eaten a gallon of it was the Crab Ceviche appetizer!

154,Elena N.,"So I decided to do a touristy day. Since a friend and I were going to be at Fisherman's Wharf, I suggested doing a seafood dinner at Pier 39. I made a reservation through Yelp for a party of two about a week prior for Thursday, September 27th at 7pm. We showed up a few mins early and had to wait for a little bit. We were seated about 10 mins after our reservation at a table by the window, so we had a nice view.

*Red Chili Garlic Shrimp: Red chili paste, onions, peppers and garlic ($16)
*AWARD WINNING CLAM CHOWDER ($9 Bowl)
*Garlic Roasted Whole Dungeness Crab: Served with vegetables and roasted fingerling potatoes and butter ($45)
*Ultimate Dirty Martini: Tito's Vodka, dry vermouth, olive juice and a blue cheese stuffed olive ($14)
*Barrel Aged Manhattan: (Up) Bulliet Bourbon, Carpano Antica Formula Sweet Vermouth house aged in 5 liter oak barrels ($14)
*Duckhorn: Napa Valley, California '17 ($50)

I wanted the crab and clam chowder. Since my friend and I always over order, we added the shrimp. The clam chowder was nice and creamy with a good amount of clams. A little thicker than I prefer, but still a good bowl. The crab was a little disappointing. There wasn't enough garlic flavor. Plus, the best part of the crab, the head, was missing. It was just an empty shell for decoration. If a restaurant states a whole crab, I think that should include the head. The shrimp were okay. Had a nice heat, but I didn't really like the sauce. A little too sweet for me. Dinner came with complimentary Bread & Butter, which was good for soup dipping.

Service here was nice and friendly. They were busy cuz there was a convention in town, so there were times when we had to flag down our server. The wine was good and paired well with our food. Both cocktails were okay. A little light for my tastes, but at least the pricing wasn't too bad.

A nice dinner for a touristy spot, but the food was a little underwhelming. 3 stars.

155,Chelsea E.,"If you want a great dining experience in the heart of the San Francisco Bay, look no further than Fog Harbor Fish House at Pier 39!

I have been here twice on two separate visits to SF. On my first visit, we were just walk ins and since there was a wait for a table, we opted for the bar (we were in a rush to get to our Alcatraz night tour!). I enjoyed sitting at the bar and our bartender was friendly and personable. I did find myself turning around a lot though to look out those big beautiful windows overlooking the Bay. ""Next time I come here, I want to sit by a window!"" I thought to myself. The first time I was there I got the seafood ravioli and it was FANTASTIC! I still think about it often. Might be some of the best ravioli I've ever had! 

Two years later, I made my way back and was smart enough to make reservations. Just as I said last time, I was able to sit near one of those windows! Although it was rainy out and was starting to get dark, I still enjoyed the experience overlooking the Bay. I imagine it's much prettier on a nice day out. 

On this second trip I was DEVASTATED to hear that they took the seafood ravioli off the menu. Booo!! Our waiter was pretty tenured because he knew what I was talking about and was even able to say ""It's probably been a few years since you've been here, right?"" Ugh dang it! I opted for the seafood penne instead. As we waited for our food to come out, I ordered a glass of Duckhorn Sauvignon Blanc. Our waiter also brought us out some delicious warm bread with whipped butter! YUM! Although unfortunately that was the highlight of my meal. My seafood penne came out and it was just very underwhelming. I didn't like it that much and couldn't stop thinking about the ravioli. I don't want to dock too many stars for this though because I think I just simply ordered the wrong thing. My sister got the clam chowder in a bread bowl and it was REALLY good! There are many other dishes here that I'd like to try in the future. 

Overall, great atmosphere, views, and food. Would love to see them bring back the ravioli again in the future!

We made our reservation online and I specifically requested a seat with a view. Our request was honored and it was a beautiful day so we had a nice few of the bay and the Golden Gate Bridge. 

We started with a bowl of clam chowder and some bread and butter. The chowder was really tasty. I just recently started eating clam chowder so I don't have many points of reference. But the flavor was nice not too heavy. We also had margaritas they were ok not really  strong tasted mostly like the mixer. 

We ordered the Fried combo and the seafood platter for our meals. The seafood platter was a nice serving of crab, shrimp, mussels, and clams with potatoes all topped with lots of garlic butter. Talk about an explosion of flavor. Seasoned really well plenty of garlic in the butter. The platter was so good I wanted more. 

The fried combo did not disappoint either. The calamari was fried nicely as well as the fish and shrimp. Of course the prices are on the higher end, but it was worth every penny.

161,Damion W.,"When you go to San Francisco, and you want food, you think of a couple different things. Some type of authentic ethnic food (i.e. Italian, Chinese, Thai, Soul, etc.) or you think of seafood! This time around, my co-workers said SEAFOOD! Although Fog Harbor is pretty commercial and crowded, they do an excellent job with their service, food, and handling the crowds. There wasn't any point in time where I felt rushed or felt like they saw me as ""just a customer."" 

As you can see from the pics the portions where significant, it had great flavor, and you could tell the seafood was fresh. Of all the seafood places I have been in the Bay Area, I would put Fog Harbor at the top and I would definitely go back. 

A word to the wise, if you go around dinnertime, plan accordingly, you are going to wait minimum 30-1 hour, so be prepared.

The steam clams were outstanding and my favorite. Oysters were fresh and delicious. The ceviche was great but kind of dry for me. Great wine selection. Overall great experience. Must try if you're in San Francisco!!

164,Kaity C.,"Our server was a bit less attentive than a normal server would be. Even the tables around us was like needing attention from him whether it be getting a check, paying a bill or simply asking for drinks. Food was alright for a restaurant by the water with a seafood base dish I had higher expectations. Some dishes were even salty but I guess so is the Pacific.

We got seats at the bar right away, and were served quickly. Good views.

We got the fried calamari, sliders, and crab cakes. So good! This place is super touristy, but I would come back if I was in the area again.

166,Hank C.,"Stopped in here for some chowder, and literally that was the only thing, although we ended up trying the oysters, too, which were small and not really that good (dry and sticky). Next time will have to ask to see what they have as the half dozen was not worth it. Front had plenty of seats though we still waited for a table.  Crayons and paper for the little one to draw on as we waited and ate.

The server was gracious and didn't complain when we only ordered a few chowders, though they came for seating, order, and drop off food and check. Not much else. I can see why they won their awards, for the sourdough bread bowl was fantastic (even my father-in-law loved it), and the chowder was excellent and well-balanced, rich with flavor and clam and just enough other potato and other veggies to keep it from being simply soup. The sourdough bread was a great starter, too. Will have to try the other seafood meals here later!

And the view of the pier and water was great. Right near the front foot of the pier adjoining the mainland, not too far to walk. There's a bar upfront which looked always open. The seats in the restaurant definitely filled up after 1pm.

169,Cynthia D.,"Amazing spot for great food with view of Alcatraz and the pier.

My party of four enjoyed our seafood dinner here and the sunset view was gorgeous. For appetizer, I tried the Clam Chowder in the bread bowl which was really creamy and tasty, fresh oysters - freakin' delicious, and even the baked oysters were noteworthy, and the crab cakes were to die for! For entrees, we got the seasonal Jumbo Scallop and Crab Meat Risotto and the Seafood Penne. Both were solid dishes! I loved the crab flavor in the risotto. 

Infamous restaurant in Fisherman's Wharf whereas the wait can be for hours. Luckily for us, Yelp Waitlist was the MVP! I wish more restaurants implement this in NYC. I simply opened my handy Yelp app and tapped to join the waitlist (must be within 40 miles) while I was commuting from my hotel in Lower Haight. It would give me an estimated time to check in with the hostess and approximately how many parties are ahead of us. My friends and I were exploring Fisherman's Wharf the entire time until time got closer. Ta Da!

The service is comparable to s high end steak house.  One thing that tip them over the edge for me is that they had little battery pack chargers for glue cellphones- they have the connector for both iOS and micro usb.  The table bread is delicious and fresh.  The menu is simple and the ingredients is very high quality.  At first glance, you might think it's a tourist trap, but it's ex

We had s Caesar salad, clam chowder and scallops with crab meat risotto.  Salad was good, clam chowder was unique- I really liked it, Cary R didn't think it was that special.  I also had half a dozen oysters that were local.  Very different flavor form our blue points.  It was delicious and they were small.  However, the scallops and crab meat risotto was out of this world.  It was hands down a show stopper.  I could eat this everyday!   We finished out meal with a banana bread pudding.  It came with a sweet milk to pour in top of it with some whip cream.  The dessert was delicious but could have been better with a scoop of ice cream since it was a warm bread pudding- whip cream didn't cut it.

172,Rebecca S.,"SF is super busy in n the summer and this restaurant conveniently let's you join the waitlist without you actually being there or calling in.  You can join the wait list like making a reservation online or through yelp and they will text you when your table is ready.  As soon as we got there we were seated right away.  They usually want all parties to be there to be seated but they seated us anyway.  The views of SF bay was so beautiful!  Mostly all seatings will have a beautiful view.  You can see Alcatraz from here.  The clam chowder bread bowl was delish!!!! YUM.  We also had the ahi tuna poke, shellfish platter, lobster roll, and calamari.  The shellfish platter was yummy and fresh and season just right with butter and garlic.   Calamari was good, but they basically added so much fried onion to it which made it look like calamari pieces which made it look like fillers which means less actual calamari pieces.  Lobster roll was a huge disappointment.  No flavor whatsoever.  I was hoping it be as good or better than the one in Truckee, but sadly it wasn't.... I ended up not eating the roll itself after taking a bite, and just ate the lobster pieces itself.  The tuna poke was good but nothing spectacular.  4 stars is for the service and views.  Food not so much, but the Clam chowder I would highly recommend.

173,Ronald M.,"One of several restaurants recommended by my friend and former coworker who took a promotion up here in San Francisco a few years back. She specifically stressed the great views while dining. So we settled on Fog Harbor for dinner, and did find the views quite romantic. 

Our server Jose was very cordial and helpful, as well as timely with bringing our water and basket of bread to the table. I was already looking forward to trying their fish & chips with cole slaw, while my wife was a bit more indecisive with her menu choice . She finally settled on the chicken penne pasta. 

And after not too long a wait, our plates arrived with a nice presentation. My meal was provided with a bottle of malt vinegar, a must with true fish & chips. I also ordered their lemonade which was above average. And overall we were quite satisfied. I've had better fish and chips but still better then average. My wife had no real complaints with her pasta and we both agreed that we definitely wouldn't mind a future return to try other menu items. I believe everything came to approximately $48.00 before tip.

175,Trang T.,"My expectations for this place was not too high since it's a well-known touristy restaurant. But it blew mine and my bf's tastebuds away!
I made a reservation on a Monday night at 7:30 pm for a table next to the window. Luckily, the sun was just setting so we could see the beautiful view. This place was packed on a Monday night so make sure you make a reservation beforehand so you don't have to wait!
Our waiter, Curtiss (I think?) was attentive, helpful, and super funny lol. He recommended some pasta dishes that aren't on the menu. Thanks to him, we got the Linguine with crab, scallops, and shrimps in garlic butter sauce and cheese (parmesan? I'm not 100% sure but I LOVED it and I usually hate cheese). The sauce had a smoky, buttery, garlicky taste to it and the pasta itself was cooked al-dente to perfection! The scallops stood out to me because it was seared on top but soft underneath. This was by far the best pasta dish we've ever had!!! I was sad when it was over lol. We also got the Cioppino (crab, scallops, shrimp, mussels, and clams). This was good as well, although the sauce was a tiny bit too salty for my taste. All the seafood tasted fresh and well seasoned. The restaurant gives out complimentary sourdough bread with butter (loved it!)
The best thing though, besides the food, view, and service, was that they split the entrees for us. So instead of giving us one plate of Cioppino, one plate of Linguine, and empty plates to share --- they divided each portion in half into two plates! We never experienced this at any other restaurant. 
All in all, get that Linguine pasta with crab, scallops, and shrimp!! Ask for it since it's not on the menu!!

We started with some oysters and a Caesar salad. Oysters were nice and fresh according to Jay O. And salad was great too just slightly overdressed to my liking. When asked about a charger for our phones Adam came right over with two portable chargers and plugged it in for us. We went with their special crabmeat risotto and scallops. Man this dish was delicious! We also went with Adams favorite dessert the bread pudding also very delicious and not overly sweet. This place is a winner! I look forward to next time!

Ordered fish and chips and the fish wasn't even white. Fish needs to be white. Very disappointing and wish I spent money elsewhere. There was a dirty cup in which the waitress filled it with San pellegrino. Once we mentioned to her that the cup was dirty (had some things floating in the cup), she proceeded to give us another cup and didn't even give us a new San pellegrino water.

I'm always kind of turned off by their prices and sort of stuffy interior, but my mom loves this place , so I oblige and we eat at the FHFH. After I get over the fact that I got defeated once again in picking my choice of restaurant for lunch, I realize how good their food actually is .  

Pretty much everything on the menu is good. The shrimp and crab salads are fresh and tasty as well as their chowders and pasta dishes. I love the super fresh and hot out of the oven sourdough rolls served with creamy butter ! Its way delicious. 

This place gets very busy due to its location in tourist heavy pier 39. Be prepared to wait for a table during peak hours on weekends. Service is friendly , but a bit slow during busy lunch and dinner hours . We somehow always end up with a table near the window overlooking the sea lions on pier 39, which is very cool, but tables are set pretty  so it can feel cramped when all tables are occupied. 

Menu prices are probably what you would expect for a touristy area in the Bay Area. But I do object from time to time . Dang , going out to eat is expensive .

Martini- alright. Had ice chips in it, no blue cheese stuffed olives, and not served in a martini glass but you know not the star here.

Clam chowder- not the best I've had but good. Not that many potatoes and it was thick and hearty. Some grit in the clams.

Steamed clams- the clams themselves were good but the broth was okay it was pretty greasy from the chorizo then had a lot of corn. So might be a flavor you like but wasn't my favorite.

Didn't have any main dishes so can't comment on that.

If there's a wait, I would honestly try your luck somewhere else. You won't be missing out on anything if you don't dine here. My favorite part of my meal was endless sourdough rolls with delicious delicious whipped butter. My weakness is sourdough bread, so much so that I got the ""Award Winning Clam Chowder"" in the sourdough bread bowl. Ok so disclaimer: I have been living in New England for the last 2 years and have had clam chowder in Maine and Boston and I wasn't too impressed with the clam chowder here. It's just OK... I do love the sourdough bread bowl because bread hellooo. I also split the linguini & clams with my mom and wasn't a huge fan of the flavor. Once again just an OK dish. The pasta and clams were cooked well but you definitely should use the lemon wedge that comes with the dish to add some acid to the flavor. Really all the dishes here seem to be just good enough. Our server was great though and kept the sourdough rolls coming.

I knew that there was going to be long waits, especially it being 4th of July and everyone hoping to see fireworks with their dinner. I was able to start my wait from my hotel room just before 6:00PM. It said to arrive at the restaurant by 7:20. We got to the Pier just before 7 to walk around. We grabbed a drink at the bar and by 8:30 we were finally seated. We didn't mind the wait, we knew what we were getting in to. 

Appetizers: Blue cheese garlic bread, 1 dozen oysters, 1 bowl of award winning clam chowder
Entrees: My boyfriend ordered the whole dungeness crab. He loved it! I had the surf& turf, it was good
Dessert: Blondie - soooo goood!!!

The crispy calamari was delicious and the lemon aioli sauce elevated the dish! The clams and linguini was excellent and a must try!

The first day when we got the whizhole manager, who said we couldn't take our happy hour drinks back to our table to dine, so we ended up having drinks (Alcatraz Escape) and calamari and having dinner elsewhere. We were back on the pier the next day, however, and the drinks and calamari from the day before were so good we decided to give it another go. They serve some type of sourdough roll that only caters to a specific tastebud. I found the outer portion a little too hard for my liking. Then I decided to try that award winning chowda and found out WHY it had won awards! O...M....GEEJUS that was DELECTABLE! We all ordered it topped with the Dungeness crab and boy do they top it. It was rich and creamy...worth every calorie! I ordered the Cioppino, which is a seafood soup, and found the tomato base to be a little overpowering for my taste buds. This time I tried the Lipstick Lemondrop which was underwhelming due to the lack of alcohol. Probably will not return, but if you decide to go the chowder, calamari, and Alcatraz are all must tries.

201,Courtney L.,"During my family's trip to San Francisco, our mission was to find a restaurant that showcased the Bay's fresh seafood at fairly reasonable prices, and Fog Harbor delivered!

Located on the second floor of Pier 39, this restaurant has a classy ambiance and a scenic view of the water where you can spot the sea lions in the distance. We were greeted by our waiter who took great care of us throughout dinner. He was personable, attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. 

We started off our seafood feast by sharing the Red Chili Garlic Shrimp appetizer ($16). It contained just six large shrimp, tossed with thin slices of onions and bell peppers in an intense chili sauce. Although I enjoyed the spicy flavors and tingling heat, I didn't find that it was the best value.  I also couldn't help but try a cup of their award-winning clam chowder ($7), which was so creamy and had large meaty clam pieces. Yum, this is a must!  

For my entree, I went with a lighter plate, being the Seared Pacific Cod ($28). The fish was seared perfectly with a golden brown, slightly crisp top. It was served with white beans, chorizo butter, tomatoes and spinach, then finished with a dab of garlic shallot aioli. The aioli added an extra layer of flavor to an already savory plate and I loved the white beans as an alternative for a starch. With the Cod placed on top of it all, it was truly the highlight of the dish. Two of my family members ordered the Mixed Grill, which was a combo of salmon, cod and shrimp served with vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes. They enjoyed their entrees as well.

This was easily one of the best seafood meals my family had in years. 
Thank you to Fog Harbor for such a memorable dinner to start off our visit to San Francisco on the right foot!

The cherry on the top was the sealions. It was truly an amazing day. That being said, although we were satiated from a touring perspective, we were very hungry and as it was getting cold, hoping for something hot, salty and greasy. This seemed like a good restaurant, had good ratings and we liked their menu. 
Between the three of us, we got a cioppino, a grilled seafood platter and a fried seafood platter. Food was hot, fresh and good portion size. Cioppino was seasoned well but the other items were a little bland. 
Service was very friendly and timely. They brought multiple servings of bread - sourdough ofcourse, very fresh.

Strong amonia smell when I cracked open the shell.   I always smell my shellfish and this failed my smell test.  Did not eat what should have been my favorite part.

I made a reservation online through Yelp, which I highly encourage because this place is busy all nights of the week. When I arrived I was immediately sat at a table.  

Fog Harbor has an expansive menu full of seafood options and many options for the non seafood lovers too. I had a hard time deciding between several entrees and went for the clam chowder to start followed by seared scallops with crab risotto. The scallops literally melt in your mouth. The crab was nice and fresh too! I visited during crab season so there were a lot of specialty items including crab.  

The restaurant has large windows overlooking the San Francisco bay. I unfortunately went when it was dark outside but I can only image the views during the day or better yet during sunset time.  

They validate for one hour of parking in the Pier 39 parking lot, which is located right across from the restaurant. Just let your server know you need your parking ticket validated before you leave.

211,Leah E.,"Fabulous restaurant and great customer service. We arrived about 15 mins early for our reservation and were seated promptly, in a booth, that had amazing views of the water and fisherman's wharf all lit up at night.  We ordered crab cakes to start. My husband had a house Manhattan, which is made with their bullet bourbon that they age in house, and I had a glass of sauvingon blanc from Sonoma. Both were wonderful.  Next we ordered garlic chili dungeness crab (on the recommendation of our server) and surf n turf for the man. Both dishes were perfectly executed and came out with great presentation. To top the evening off, I was surprised with a birthday dessert, the chocolate bread pudding was to die for!

213,Susan M.,"This was absolutely my favorite meal in San Fran. Their crab risotto with scallops exceeded my expectations. Risotto was so flavorful and the scallops were well seasoned and seared. Their clam chowder was delicious, creamy and was obviously freshly made.

My husband regretted his spicy crab just because he didn't realize it would be an actual crab.. which was huge btw but he doesn't like messy food in general, so just something to keep in mind. (They provide a bib to give you an idea lol)

Inside is just beautiful and classy, with good views of the water. Overall, this is a good pick for a nice occasion, or if you're just looking for delicious seafood in the Fisherman Wharf area with a nice ambiance and friendly, polite service. 

Side note: to the lovely waitress who said thank you to us on our way out, my jet lagged brain's immediate response was to say 'you're welcome!' Sorry! Although it's probably long forgotten, thought I'd put it out there :D

215,Rita L.,"I was looking for a happy hour place with light appetizers after visiting the Fisherman's Wharf. I yelped the highest rated place and BOOM! Fog Harbor Fish House was just the right place. I believe the bar is the only area where you can order the happy hour specialty items 

We had the crispy lemon calamari, New England clam chowder in a bowl, and two glasses of wine. The calamari was perfectly cooked and tender with a crispy exterior. I devoured the clam chowder--abundant amount of clams in the soup and the bread was kept warm due to the soup. I love sourdough bread so this was a perfect addition to our meal. The service was great partially because it was easy to get the bartender's attention because we were seated at the bar. 

Definitely come here for the happy hour specials if you're looking for something light!

216,Christopher L.,"Great place to come on the weekends for lunch and a great view. We came on a Sunday at 11:00 AM and there was no wait and plenty of window-side tables available. 

We actually had brunch reservations down the street at Surisan at 12:30 but decided to just stop by for some chowder haha.. We only ordered clam chowder and crab cakes so I can't speak too much on the food, but everything we did have was great. Crab cakes especially!

218,Tomas R.,"I'm not a fan dining in tourist heavy sights but damnit I will make an exception for Fog Harbor Fish House. I've had the opportunity to dine formally and at the bar at different locations. FHFH is on the second floor and you'll see it from the central location of The Wharf. When you walk up the stairs you'll see an outdoor waiting area with a fireplace where you can wait for your table. You'll be able to check-in with the main host there as well.

If you're looking to skip the line and simply want to grab a bite to eat, as well as, drinks then walk on in to the bar. The bar area is open seating and it's first come first serve. You can enjoy the full menu of FHFH at the bar so that's always a win! No need to worry about a dedicated bar menu.

When you're deciding what to eat make sure to take a look at their seasonal menu.

I have to tell y'all though...
If you don't grab a bowl of their clam chowder, then you're doing yourself an injustice. Their clam chowder is so good you'll be licking the plate clean. You have to add crab meat to the chowder which takes it to the next level. You get such huge chunks of clam and the crab meat for $7 is A STEAL. Pretty sure you're getting way more for your buck without the messiness of opening crab legs yourself.

Although I didn't order this due to the limitation of available space in my stomach (you can only loosen your belt so much) I have ordered their Signature Shellfish Tower which is served cold but includes lobster, dungeness crab, shrimp, and oysters. A great appetizer to order for a party of 4 alongside some of their other apps.

The few dishes I've had there have all been great, but the service is what keeps me coming back for more. Although you may be situated within a highly trafficked tourist area, they don't take advantage of you. They treat each table with pride and they take the time to make sure you have a great dining experience.

Sadly every time I've gone I've yet to learn my lesson to make room for dessert when they bring around the dessert presentation. ONE DAY, ONE DAY....

I got the Seafood Penne, and compared to other seafood pastas I've had, it wasn't the best. My boyfriend got the clam chowder and it was really good. I'm wishing I got that instead. It's super fancy inside and the view is great.

Oysters were so fresh and sweet. I'm usually used to the happy hour blue pt oysters but these were smaller but sweeter.

Crab cakes were great as well.

First time trying cioppino. I really enjoyed it. We got it lazy style and crab meat was already picked out for us.

Service was great. Atmosphere would be great for date night. We were sat by a window and overlooking the boats and water.

222,tracy d.,"Went here for dinner. I had the shellfish platter with lobster tail and garlic noodles. It was delicious. My fiancé had the crab topped with fillet mignon he wasn't too happy with it, it was dry and his mash potatoes were to wet you know how it's suppose to be creamy, but yeah we also had the Ahi Poké it was so bomb! That got killed real fast by my fiancé lol . The chowder was pretty good too. Overall the food was great just besides the one my fiancé had for his entree. They were busy it was a little bit of a wait. Our server was great although he was very forgetful, but times like that when it's crazy busy it's ok. He even opened up our plastic wrapped wet paper that was sweet. The appetizers came out good timing and after we were able to chill before our entrees came out so we weren't stuffed too much with our appetizers. We left satisfied. :)

The crispy wanton chips were the perfect compliment. Fish and chips were pretty standard. The Cioppino was a savory with generous portion and a good variety of seafood. There's more meat if you choose the ""lazy"" option and have them crack the crab.

Sourdough rolls. Wowza. Warm rolls with whipped butter has this Southerner well pleased. 

I ordered the Pacific Sole and it was perfectly cooked down to the fingerling potatoes and spinach. The entree was light enough, with a punch of flavor from the fish. Would pick again. 

All and all, plenty of food to fill your belly or simply have a bite to eat. I will be back when in the San Fran area!

Kept it simple and ordered the fries and mussels. I enjoyed the creamy white sauce that it came in, my partner not so much. We both got the clam chowder in bread bowl and it did not disappoint. Creamy, delicious, hearty. Everything and anything you could ask for.

Wish we had more time to come back, or were hunger that night, because looking around - this is must go to spot for seafood. Plus you're on the pier, and can do fun activities before and after!

226,Geneva L.,"Great place for dinner. Nice view of the pier and cozy ambiance. I recommend putting your name down on the wait list ahead of time as it gets really busy. 

Our server was really attentive, regularly checked in to see if we had everything we needed. I wasn't sure if we're were supposed to get a bread basket, but I noticed it on other tables as I was walking out. 

The drinks were good.   If you like a lighter cocktail, the Alcatraz Escape is a nice drink. My friend had the recommended wine and she liked it too.  The food came out pretty quickly and tasted great. 

The calamari was really crispy and the potion was decent. The soup wasn't bad but they're wasn't much since it's in a bread bowl.  Unless you plan in eating the entire bread bowl, I'd recommend getting it on a regular bowl.  The seared scallop and crab risotto was awesome highly recommend it.  The kitchen helped spilt our order into 2 separate plates, since we told the server we were sharing,  so that was nice. 

Overall, if you're in the SF area, I'd recommend eating at this restaurant.

My family and I opted to wait to ensure we had a lovely window view of the bay.  Upon sitting there I was so distraught because the Forbes lighthouse is gone :(. I didn't even realize that it was taken away!  It's been a while since I've gone to the touristy areas of San Francisco. 

They call the clam chowder the award winning one and it is definitely worth ordering.  I grew up with Boudin so sorry Fog Harbor, my heart still lies with Boudin.  But still great tasting.

Hand down though please order the scallop crab risotto!  My mouth is salivating just writing and thinking about it.  I need it now!  If you go bring me some :P.

This place opens earlier than most other restaurants in the area so we got there around 10:45am, still had plenty of window seats. By 11:45-12noon, the place was packed and the line was crazy, so glad we went early. 
We ordered the cioppino (not the lazy cioppino) and the seafood (order for 1); very fresh ingredients-crab, great scallops, mussels, and shrimp. Seafood platter was so flavorful, Cioppino was a bit on the salty side but overall good flavor. We put in the linguini from the platter into coppino at the end and when the pasta soaked up all the sauce, that was just a satisfying ending. We also dipped fresh sourdough bread with the coppino sauce, another excellent carb ending to the meal!

This place isn't cheap especially the wine but hey when you're on vacation why not.  I started with the west coast style oysters which were chucked and chilled perfectly. Next, came the Caesar which was way larger then I was expecting, I'd definitely split this if you come with a guest.  I was really craving some clam chowder and I'm glad I was because theirs was stuffed with fresh clams..so good.  For desert I went with the apple crumble special with ice cream on top. I didn't come anywhere close to finishing but it was totally worth it.

We tried to make reservations but were told the weren't taking any on this day, July 4th. The wait was about 25 minutes, this was faster than estimated but it was okay because we got to listen to the live band playing on Pier 39.

For the food my dining partner had the fried seafood platter, based on her response it was just okay. I had the clam chowder with crabmeat and I was underwhelmed! As for the rest of the patrons they looked satisfied and their food looked tasty. One special was grilled scallops with risotto my neighbor had it and it was mostly risotto.

I would have to order a full meal to truly assess the food. The clam chowder was okay I had much better in Monterey. The service was good and prompt once seated but I couldn't se myself making a special trip to dine here.

254,Amanda B.,"I was pleasantly surprised by our experience at Fog Harbor! My parents and I were in town for a race through Golden Gate Park over the weekend and wanted to treat ourselves to a quality seafood meal afterward. We typically shy away from Pier 39 as it's the quintessential tourist trap however Fog Harbor offers more than that: we were greeted with a killer view of Alcatraz, Angel Island, and even a ferry or two to accompany the exceptionally friendly service we received from Jeremy. 

Each of us ordered the Pacific Sole (pan seared and served with roasted fingerling potatoes, spinach, peppers, tarragon, and a caper beurre blanc) and were extremely happy with our choice! Many restaurants seem to focus on shellfish dishes and forget that a quality fillet can be just as satisfying to some restaurant-goers but the Fog Harbor chefs clearly understand what they're doing in the kitchen! The fish was flaky and well-seasoned, the spinach was a perfect al dente texture, and the caper beurre blanc was salty and creamy without being too heavy. 

Our drinks were a little disappointing, however. One glass of wine came from a bottle that tasted as if it had been opened a day or two too long and the ginger lemonade, although refreshing and full of fresh ginger, lacked the oomph I expected.

I'd be happy to bring friends and family back to Fog Harbor for the seafood but will save our drink orders for a different place.

257,Justin L.,"Came here because I was determined to hit a seafood place in SF, despite the fact that my wife doesn't eat seafood (shame).  Fog Harbor is right by Fisherman's wharf and is very nice inside.  It has a good view of the harbor and, depending on where you sit, the seals that park themselves along the docks.  Service was good, albeit a bit slow and very ""corporate"".  Glad I came here for lunch, however I wish their main attraction had been a bit better.

On a whim, I got the clam chowder for a starter.  I don't normally order this or even like it, but opted to because of how famous it is around here.  It was very good with plenty of chunks of crab.  Probably was one of the best I've had.  I got the crab roll for my main because I didn't want to get my hands dirty at the time.  I was disappointed that the crab roll didn't contain lump crab meat.  The bun was nice, buttery bread, however there was too much in ratio to the crab.  It was fine overall but not great like I was hoping for.  I enjoyed the $1 shots of crab I had down the street beforehand which were also higher quality meat.  My wife got a burger which she said was good

Will try another place next time in Fisherman's wharf.  This place wasn't as bad as a tourist spot could be, however there has to be a better option nearby.  Either that or stick to the clam chowder and perhaps the actual Dungeness crab entrees.

Ambiance 5/5
Dock/upscale feeling with large windows. MOSTLY every spot in the restaurant gets a good view. Lots of booths and tables.

Food 5/5
We were looking forward to eating oysters pretty much the entire time we were in San Francisco. However, I would have to say the oysters were the most underwhelming part of the meal. They were tasty but not $3 each tasty. A roll of sourdough bread is given per person after ordering food with butter. 
With the rest of the food that we ordered they were really generous with the amount of seafood. 
1. Cioppino- very delicious, 2 jumbo shrimp, 2 scallops, a lot of fish, muscles, clams and garlic toast bread
2. Seafood pasta - creamy tomato sauce (HEAVEN), very rich but yummy, 2 jumbo shrimp, muscles, clams and lots of fish
3. Steamed clams - So delicious, comes in a good sized bowl with some bread on top. 

Out of all of them the seafood pasta was my favorite but I like rich food.

Price 
Check in at pier 39 on yelp and they give you a free coupon book when you go to the information center (2 stores down from Fog House) they also gave us a card for 15% off ENTIRE BILL including drinks at Fog house, biscoff and Pier market seafood. 
1. $18- 6 Oysters, this is what is listed on their menu but you can order them in increments of 1 for $3 each 
2. $34  - Cioppino 
3. $24 - Seafood pasta 
4. $18 - Steamed clams

259,Leah C.,"My husband and I were in the area because we needed to catch a flight the following morning. We found this place on Google because it was a popular place with great reviews. 

Although we were both recovering from colds, we decided to make our one and only night in SF a fun one. Sadly, we ordered and as the appetizers were coming out, my husband decided he couldn't sit and eat so we took it Togo. Our waitress was friendly and nice and more than accommodating. 

Once we got to our car, we dug in and it was good! I ordered the shrimp brochette. Hubs had the seared ahi. We got a bowl of chowder to split and the calamari. Everything was on point. I didn't try the chowder, but my husband said it was really good especially with the crab topper. The calamari had jalapenos and onions add to it, which made it so much better than regular calamari. My shrimp brochette was delicious. The seared ahi was really good too. 

Overall, I would recommend this place. It's on Pier 39, which is a great tourist spot for shopping and hanging out. It's a little pricy, but definitely a restaurant you would want to go to for a night out with friends or a date night.

261,Monica K.,"Long wait on a Sunday afternoon and no advance reservations allowed. Walked through the restaurant while waiting to use the restroom and saw at least 10 empty tables. Hostesses were also rude when approached to ask wait times. 

Food was okay. Tried the clam chowder bread bowl and shellfish platter. You can find a bread bowl on any corner of the wharf and you're overpaying to eat it here. The crab in the shellfish platter had little to no meat in it. Entree was covered in too much garlic. We also had 2 vegetarians in our party and extremely limited options available-- they tried a couscous with veggie and pasta with veggie dishes. Both bland and lacked salt. 

If you're looking for overpriced food with a good view, this is your spot.

262,Marisol T.,"Obviously the sourdough chowder bowl is life! I mean it was creamy and so flavorful. I had never had chowder, so I was not sure what to expect. Wow did they really surprise me. Service was great, we got a table with a view of the bay. The fish and chips was very good also, we were all happy to have made reservations so we did not have to wait much. This was an awesome lunch, please don't miss this place, it's totally worth the hype!

We also got the Dungeness crab cocktail which was so fresh and paired so well with the cocktail sauce. The finishing touch was the seafood penne. Amazing!

264,Tristina B.,"Bottom Line: I was drawn in by the clam chowder and didn't find it that awesome! Service is lovely, nice view, but touristy area.

Food: Granted, clam chowder is EVERYWHERE in this area, but the reviews for Fog Harbor along with the appetizing pictures drew me in. I was looking for a nice dinner and chose this place. I thought the food was OKAY for the prices, but nothing TJ blow my socks off. I didn't think the lump crab added to my clam chowder was anything special to be honest! The drinks, however, I loved! 

Atmosphere: It looks a little fancy, but you can come as is. I enjoy the location by the water although the tourist crowd that's on the way of getting there can be annoying.... but if you're dining in this area you already know what to expect!

Service: Our server was great- no complaints!

Overall I feel like you can go somewhere a tad bit better if you're looking for your nice dinner :)

265,Debbie L.,"i came here when i went to sf because it was the most highly rated on yelp.
i give this 4 stars because it was good food, but it was pricey and nothing about the meals were too particularly good. i understand the price was high because we did get good seafood dishes, and our claim chowder with crabs in it as well, but we also ordered a fish and chips and it was good, but not great. 
i would recommend this place if you'd like to splurge a bit, but also the place comes with an amazing view so it's a nice place to try while vacationing and touristing!

266,Courtney J.,"This is definetly a tourist trap but, if you're eating at Pier 39 you should have expected it. That aside this is very nice restaurant. Quite busy even in a late Sunday evening. The restaurant does validate the parking garage if that's a concern.

Down to the Food: I sat at the bar as it was super busy and the bartender was very nice and attentive but it's the bar at pier so it is slammed. I had the clam chowder and it's very thick creamy and has a good flavor. It's the ""Award Winning"" but very simple. No thrills but good. I also ordered the garlic roasted whole crab. The garlic is strong. Though it seems to be missing a key flavor the crab is fresh and pairs nicely with the garlic. I'd ask for a side of drawn butter as the plate is indeed missing a certain something. The green beans are flash cooked but with a good crunch. However, there's no seasoning to them. I enjoyed the meal overall but, I'm sure San Fran has more to offer on the seafood scene.

267,Kourtney M.,"Utilized yelp waitlist and only waited less than 10 mins to be seated. I forget our waitress' name, but she was short with curly hair. She was funny and nice.

Our waitress brought over sourdough rolls with butter, this was delish (esp the butter). We started with a bowl of clam chowder to share. It had a good amount of clams in each scoop and was very good.

Our waitress dropped off bibs for the mess we're about to encounter and she put the bibs on for us! Not sure if she was supposed to but i found it amusing. Thought she might be cracking the crab shells for us but we weren't that lucky. Lol

We ordered the lobster roll which came on a buttery bun served with house made potato chips. The lobster could've had a little more butter/taste, but still good. The chips were just ok.. not much taste. We also got the seafood platter for 1 to share. There were about 6 pieces of each seafood (shrimp, mussels and clam) with a piece of crab. They were all soaking in an amazing buttery herb garlic sauce which we dipped the lobster roll in. The sauce was sooo delicious!!

Our check came with a biscoff cookie for each person and a coupon at the bottom of the receipt for 20% off our coffee purchase at the biscoff store (downstairs).

Walked in on a Monday afternoon, no reservations available for that evening but told to come back for a walk in. Came in around 6pm and was seated within 5 mins at window table with a beautiful water view. Attended to right away, and perfectly throughout the night. 

Went with the house salad and split the special of scallops and crab risotto between the two of us. They brought it out already portioned on two separate plates which is always a nice touch. I'm not even a huge scallop fan because of the texture, but they were so good I ate them all. And that risotto!! I really just wanted to jump in a vat of it...so buttery, creamy, and downright delicious!!

Great experience and highly recommended!!

270,Trinh V.,"We came here on a Friday night and we were lucky that we got a reservation that day! When we walked in there was already a crowd of people waiting to be sat and now I can see why. Most places on the water are tourist traps and the prices are usually high but we were on vacation and also wanted to see the sunset so here goes it. 

We requested a table next to the window where we could see the sunset. Our waitress was kind and we had no issues here with service.

Drinks:
-Hibiscus Marg (4.5/5): Delicious! A sweet but not too sweet drink. 
-Lipstick Lemondrop (3.5/5): Not my fav lemondrop. It was ok

Food:
-1/2 Baked Oysters (5/5): I am such a huge connoisseur for baked oysters and these were so delicious. It's hot so be careful. I requested no bacon. 

-Shellfish Platter (4/5): It comes with 1/2 crab, mussels, clams, shrimp, and potatoes. The whole platter is doused in butter and it lays on a puddle of butter and garlic. The minced garlic tasted amazing. The butter was a little overwhelming but it was decent and filling. It's pretty messy so they have a bib for you. 

-Fried Combo: I did not try this so I can't rate this dish.

-Creme Brûlée (4/5): Omg I'm not a huge creme brûlée fan but they have the best creme brûlée I have ever tasted!

-Blondie (4/5): So nutty and delicious!

The sunset was covered by the clouds so we couldn't see much but from what we could see it was beautiful! Delicious food and great service.

Husband and oldest daughter had some big plates of seafood and said wasa delicious.

Crab, calamari, fried fish - all delicious and moist to the ""T"". 
The rolls served with butter was delicious.
Perfect warmth and crunchiness and the butter had the right consistency and flavor.

Chicken penne has amazing flavor too.

It was also my daughters birthday, they gave her a free dessert and we sang HBD to her. Made the dinner even better.

272,Nathan L.,"We looked around on the Google to see what restaurants were near Fisherman's Wharf and check out menus. In the past, I haven't done my research and had less than awesome experiences here. Just because they all serve fish doesn't mean they all do it right! 

We liked the menu and the establishment looked upscale so we decided to give Fog Harbor Fish House a try for dinner. We arrived without reservation (Thursday) and we had a 20 min wait. We decided to wait at the bar and my buddy tried a new type of whisky (Balvenie 17) per the bartender recommendation. He was stoked with it!

The table was ready soon after and we decided on the menu items. We shared the crab cakes starter, I had a bowl of chowder, and then the Seafood Mixed Grill. My buddy had the bread bowl chowder with crab as an entree. Let me tell you, everything was delicious! The crab cakes were cooked to perfection and had many levels of flavor. The chowder was among the best I've had, and the mixed grill was superb! The least favorite part was the mashed potatoes which were not quite creamy how I like best, but I was more than full by this time so it didn't matter much. 

The service was excellent from bartender to server to farewell from the staff upon departure. I highly recommend Fog Harbor Fish House if you want top notch seafood at reasonable prices. Nothing to complain about here. Check it out!

273,Prasiddha H.,"Came to Fog Harbor on a Wednesday for lunch and luckily there wasn't much of a wait. This place is in the heart of pier 39 and an extremely popular place to come to. I decided to check it out. Now let me say that my rating for this restaurant is purely on the food that I had as the service was exceptional. During my time here I was able to order and true:

Clam chowder - this was really good but I did not find it exceptional. I feel I've had better chowder in seattle although they did not skimp on the clam which was provided in the chowder

Cioppino - I was very disappointed by this dish as another friend had told me she liked it when she went. I felt that the broth here was not flavorful and also a little on the salty side. The seafood here is definitely fresh but what is food if it's not in a proper sauce

Crab cakes - this was the only dish which I enjoyed as the cakes were crispy warm and full of crab! I really enjoyed this one and would try if one decided to visit

274,Aaron N.,"This is probably the best fish on pier 39. You get a wide variety of food and it is worth eating. I got a salmon and sliders. The sliders were to die for with the sauce and the aioli. The salmon was also pretty good. I tried some of the fish and chips from my friends plate an they were pretty good. The bread and butter was also a great start to a wonderful meal. The view is great because we saw the pier and some seals. The seating isn't crowded and spaced correctly. The service is great and I was impressed by how fast they came. Overall I totally recommend this to anyone who loves food and a great view.

When that was all we ordered, well along with a clam appetizer. Anyways, server did not refill our waters once or ask how we were doing. I had asked for Tabasco and he completely forgot. Meanwhile, he waited hand and foot on other tables around us. Made us feel like second class citizens. So sad! Will not be returning here. Take off the ""Award Winning"" Clam Chowder if you're going to make people feel ""less than"" for ordering just that. On a positive note my husband did say the steamed clams were delicious.

The waiter was extremely sweet and very attentive during the evening as it slowly got busier in the restaurant full or tourists, definitely not a locals spot especially since its on Pier 39.

We ordered the calamari, caesar ""salad"", cioppino and the filet mignon topped with crab. 
Everything was delicious along with the bread and butter they serve you while you wait for your food. The calamari came out very quickly. The best part was that he asked ""if we ready for our entrees"" instead of just throwing them onto the table and being stuck with all the food. 

LET ME TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE DESSERT!!! 
So they bring out a plastic version of the desserts they offer so you can see what they have to offer. I immediately said ""everything!"" it all looks so good! But since we were sharing i went for the Duo dessert which was the creme brulee and chocolate molten cake with ice cream. TO DIE FOR! I did not care how full I was I wanted to finish the dessert. Next time I'm trying the banana pudding.

We started with the award winning clam chowder and I could certainly see why it won the award. It was delicious. So was the Dungeness Crab cocktail. 
Of course we had to have the Cioppino which was fantastic. The steamed whole Dungeness Crab was well received. And the Crab Ceviche was outstanding.

Overall, dining experience was great. Quick service, great sourdough bread, dungeness crab cakes were delicious, fish and chips were standard, nothing different than most places nearby, and the lobster roll was fine. I'm spoiled with Luke's and their butter soaked, garlic-y lobster along with their perfect bun. But these are not Maine lobsters so we weren't expecting the same. Overall, food was worth the price and we had good and fast service. Our cocktails were good as well. Would I go back? Probably not. But I'd suggest it to anyone looking for food on that strip.

I can't stress enough how delicious this place is, even though it can be a little pricey but if you love seafood you will enjoy this place.

The reviews and photos on yelp made this place seem great

I walked over from my hotel and sat at the bar to watch the NBA playoffs with the SF Bay in the background- not a bad setting

Ordered a beer and a Prisoner wine

So far all was good- but the food to me was so so

I ordered the steamed clams to start and to me although tasty, it was overly salted and smothered in corn- to me not successful

I also had their famous Cioppino which seemed to lack flavor- disappointed

282,Brianna N.,"Fog Harbor 100% lived up to the high expectations I had after reading so many great reviews!

This cute spot is on Pier 39, so at first I thought, oh no! It's a tourist trap! But it was a damn good one! The view overlooking the bay is stunning and can be seen from a majority of the tables in the dining room. 

I had to get the hibiscus margarita when I saw it won best margarita in San Francisco; it did not disappoint! Soooo good, if you're feeling a cocktail, go for this one! 

For a little app, my husband and I split a bowl of the clam chowder (which they kindly split into two cups for us) with the dungeness crab. Holy. Smokes. It's honestly the best clam chowder I've ever had. I'd say it's a must-order from this place. For the mains, the hubbs got the sea scallops with crab risotto. He  said it was the best risotto he's ever had and grudgingly gave me a bite- it was amazing! I don't think I would have shared had it been mine (jk, kind of). I felt like I had to do the cioppino since it's an SF classic, and I enjoyed it! I much prefer olive oil based sauces or a white sauce to red sauces, but the seafood was all so fresh and delicious, I didn't even mind. I'm really glad I tried it!

Don't let not getting a reservation keep you from going. We went for a late lunch/early dinner (around 4 o'clock on a Tuesday) and didn't even have to wait. This was my fave meal of our SF trip, highly recommend!

285,Chris M.,"This restaurant offers fine dining set on the second level of Pier 39. You will hopefully not have to wait long, but the waiting area offers comfortable seating with a gas fireplace and waterfall feature. I opted for the Yelp waitlist feature, which proved to be very useful. We waited a few minutes once we checked in, but I noticed a party of five that arrived right after us had to wait about 45 minutes. (We were a party of six, with two small children and two younger teens.)

The restaurant had a lovely ambience, with large windows spanning the walls. The restaurant was very busy and filled with couples, families, and other parties of varying number. The walkway through the restaurant was quite narrow, but they seemed to maximize the use of their space, as seating itself was fine. There was extensive bar seating, as well as booths and tables.

The menu had a good offering of seafood options, even on the kids menu. The kids menu not only included typical offerings like grilled cheeses and burgers, but also salmon and grilled shrimp. There were also some food options for those in your party that might not like seafood.

Table service was prompt and excellent. I was impressed with how quickly our food arrived. The restaurant was very busy, but the food arrived quickly even by conventional standards.

We were offered delicious rolls with whipped butter, after placing our order. Among our party, we ordered cheeseburgers, clam chowder in a bread bowl, lobster roll, and crab tater tots, as well some ginger beer.

All orders were excellent. I was pleasantly surprised by the potato chips, which are made in-house; they are slightly thicker than regular crisps, and have a great crunch.

Prices are not cheap, but not surprising/typical given it's a seafood restaurant and on Pier 39 (and my children's over-ordering of non-alcoholic ginger beer).

I can't offer any information regarding parking as I arrived with a group and did not have to worry about parking.I

288,Vickie Z.,"Don't let the location of Pier 39 scare you off as a tourist trap. Having lived in the city for over 3 years, this is one of THE BEST seafood places I've ever had. Recommend making reservations so you can ask for a window seat next to the water... oh, and the seals.

The meal: 
* Clam chowder ($9 for bowl) - This is their award-winning clam chowder. Wowza, I could see why! Forget Boudin, this is the winner right here. They give you so much variety and freshness of seafood in this bowl of goodness right here. Plus, no need for a bread bowl when they serve complimentary sourdough bread for the table. IMO, dipping the bread and soaking up all the chowder flavor is much better than having a bread bowl. Mmm!

* Jumbo Scallop & Crab Risotto ($35) - SEASONAL ITEM. Wow again. These were some of the best scallops I've ever had in my life. They were so buttery and juicy and perfectly seared. The risotto was creamy and the crab made it even more flavorful. The dab of pesto was a nice touch. 

* Cioppino ($34) - Ok to be fair, by the time this came out, I had stuffed myself silly with sourdough bread and the above two dishes. This was still amazing though. Very flavorful and wonderfully decorated with an abundant of seafood. No tough pieces, everything F R E S H. Note, they provide you bibs so don't be afraid to get the cioppino the normal way (and opt out of the additional $6 services for the ready-to-eat way). 

All their menu items come from 100% sustainable seafood. Additionally, service was wonderful. They knew we were sharing all items, and split our entrees into two beautifully plated dishes. Everything was divine.

We came here for a birthday dinner and a bunch of my company got the award winning clam chowder. They thought it was okay and nothing special. We also go the dungeness crab cakes which were actually quite delicious. We all ended up getting a 4 person shellfish tower, which ended up being super expensive but very delicious. The quantity of the food was amazing and it was delicious. Overall it was a balance of just okay, very pricey, very crowded, but not all bad. So I'm giving it an average review.

293,Benedict A.,"Came here for dinner last night.  Its right on pier 39 overlooking the marina.  Seevice was good.  Our waitress was nice and attentive.  Ambience was inviting.  Food though was sub par, especially for the price.  The seafood was so so.  Following is a breakdown of what we ordered.
Appetizers
Calamari- crunchy batter.  Well seasoned.  Had only 1 dipping sauce.  4/5 stars
Steamed clams- broth was good, great flavors.  Actual clams were very small and not cooked well. 3/5
Baked oysters- this was so over priced.   $37 for a dozen, and man were they small!!  They should put ""baby oysters"" under their description of it because it was that small.  They are not worth it at all.  Yea the sauce and topping on it was good, but its not worth $37. 1/5
Garlic bread with blue cheese.  Bread was toasted well and the blue cheese is really in your face.  But it was a good balance.  4/5
Main course
Lightly seared ahi tuna steak with garlic jasmine rice and vegetables.  The ahi tuna was nice and thick.  Barely seared edges with the nice raw interior.  Taste was good.  But the soy sauce on the rice was just too much!!  Made it way to salty and unpalatable.  3/5
Clam chowder with crab meat on top was really good.  The chowder was thick and creamy.  And the crab meat (extra $7) was well worth the cost.  Large chunks of crab meat and they were pretty generous with the amount of crab meat they put on it.  Most definitely the best thing I had here.  5/5
Drink
Moscow mule.  Amount of alcohol they put in it was light.  And for $14 I would have expected a lot more alcohol content.  Flavors tho were light.  Wish it had a fruitier flavor to it.  There was also too much ice in it and it really watered down the flavor. 2/5.

For 5 people and drinks the bill came out to over $380.  Location is great but for the price you're only really paying for the view.  Because the food here... was not impressive.   I had fresher seafood (better cooked as well) in Denver #pappadeaux.

We had a reservation as this place can get busy. 
We were seated promptly and the view was amazing, the atmosphere was romantic and not too casual. Our server was very nice.

For our starter he had the famous clam chowder with crab on top and I had the oysters. Both were very tasty. Of course his clam chowder was more filling but I definitely loved my light but super nutritious fresh oysters. 

My entree was the mixed grill of salmon, cod and shrimps with veggies. Very tasty and juicy salmon, but the shrimps had the best taste and the cod, well that is why this place got 4 stars instead of 5, the cod was off, not very fresh or tasty. 

His entree was sole with vegetables and potato purée. He  loved it and I had a bite of the sole that was really yummy. 

We felt really good after this dinner and walk on the pier and will be back here soon again.

300,Liza F.,"My boyfriend and I only stopped by during happy hour when we had finished walking around Fisherman's Wharf. This is definitely one of the better stops on this pier - the ambiance, food, service, etc. We sat at the bar and the bartender was knowledgeable about the different cocktails and wines. We had ordered the garlic spicy shrimp appetizer which wasn't anything to talk about, but still had a great time hanging out. Great view as well if you're by the windows! I'd definitely love to try their dinner menu next time in town.

301,Erik A.,"In town for a turn around trip and was browsing Yelp for an interesting place to eat.    The reviews on yelp were super strong I had to try because I couldn't believe it.  Well, the reviews were spot on!   Food was nothing short of superb.    I had the chili shrimp app with a bowl of clam chowder.  The shrimp were succulent and tasty and the clam chowder.....well, let's just say I had to refrain from eating the entire bread bowl and licking the plate (hence making a spectacle of myself).  Both dishes were done so well.   If you are a New England chowder fan, this is the place for you.   I had to write this review now before I waddled back to my hotel and passed out from a food coma.

303,Robert H.,"Location is nice if you are looking for somewhere in a touristy place.  I sat near the restrooms at a middle table.  The table at times was awkward as people were always walking by my food.  

As for the food, I had the clam chowder bread bowl, crab cakes and fish & chips.  Chowder was good not great, but the bread bowl made it better.  Crab cakes were good and same for the fish.  I had a good experience here and the staff was on point.   I didn't think the food was amazing but might go back someday.

Bob,
We were there on Sunday the 25th of August.  I think the staff did great.  The layout of the establishment felt extremely cramped.  I get it, it is a business and more tables = more business.  Just felt like there was no personal space for the duration of our meal.

304,Sophia J.,"The wait was longer than we were informed. It was raining horribly outside they told us the wait was an hour but we ended up waiting an hour and a half. That was the only flaw. The muscle fries were absolutely amazing I will come back just for that.

305,Wendy W.,"So. It was pricey. The view is of the dock harbor is on one side and seals on a dock the other side. It is crowded, so I recommend reservations if your going for lunch or dinner on the weekend. The shell fish tower was really fresh and good and the highlight. We could of just eaten that with our drinks and stopped...but eh.  If you like sweet drinks try the lipstick lemon drop. 
You can park in the garage across the street from the pier. Make a day of of it and go and visit the illusion museum (also recommend a reservation), Madame Tussaud's, Ripley's believe it or not and the Blue and gold fleet. Just wander around the piers, yes there is more then one.

306,Kaitlyn D.,"Our dinner at Fog Harbor was good. It is definitely a tourist trap. The view of the bay is lovely but we didn't feel our meals were worth the price we paid. Being pregnant, I loved that they offered non-alcoholic ""cocktails"". I had the strawberry basil nojito and it was delicious. We started with a Caesar salad to share and it was underwhelming. I could have prepared a better one at home. My husband also had a cup of the clam chowder which he said was very good. He got the cioppino and said it was good but not worth the price. I had the flat steak, which again was good but not worth the price. Our service was ok but not to the standard I expect from a restaurant of this caliber. If ever in the San Francisco area again, I don't think we'll return.

307,Marian M.,"Very popular place at Pier 39 in San Francisco Fisherman's Wharf. The restaurant is always crowded and you have to wait. We ended up eating at the bar table which was perfectly fine. The service was good and the food is really tasty.

308,Brittney P.,"All because of a picture posted on Instagram my friends and I found ourselves here for dinner on a Sunday around 5pm. 

The outside waiting area was cute with a fireplace. We walked into an empty bar but most of the dinner tables were occupied. The view was nice (wish we could have sat right next to the window but no biggie). The restaurant was very nice and the natural light was great. I loved the ambiance. Oh yeah the view... was beautiful. We were able to watch the sunset!

The sourdough bread was amazing! It was perfectly baked. We loved it, better than Boudin's. We ordered a Stella, House Cab, and House White Zin for drinks. My girlfriend ordered the seafood Penne pasta and a cup of clam chowder. Our friend ordered the lobster tails and the house salad. I ordered the lobster tails and a cup of clam chowder. Holy wow! It was all so delicious! The clam chowder was hands down the best clam chowder I have ever had. The lobster tails were succulent and a great size! The dish could feed two if an appetizer and sourdough bread were consumed. The mashed potatoes with chives were moist. The green beans were overcooked and limp. The seafood pasta was great. The amount of seafood in the pasta was ""overwhelming"" in a good way. They did not skimp out on the seafood. It was a delight to see that the amount of seafood the pasta was the perfect amount. 

The service was great. Our waitress was super attentive and very nice. 

Definitely recommend this place. Pricey (for me) but you get a view with exceptional food. Worth every penny!

310,Vicki A.,"One of our favorites! I normally avoid the restaurants at Pier 39 because they are crowded and overpriced but I make an exception for this place. Yes, it is crowded but the wait usually isn't too long or sometimes we eat at the bar.  The main reason we come here are for the mussell fries. They are to die for!  We typically enjoy all of the food we order but these keep us coming back on a regular basis. Almost all of the tables have a lovely view. Combine that with attentive, fast service makes this place worth coming back to again and again! For those that are gluten free (like me) the menu is labeled and they have plenty of options.

312,Joan H.,"Came here on a whim with my family for a day at the pier!

We were looking for a snack, and was convinced on this Shellfish Platter which was spectacular! Service was great. We were greeted and seated immediately. Our server was excellent--especially putting our bibs on. Not to mention, we had a nice view of the bay even though we were not sitting next to the windows.

The food? Bread was nice and toasty. The Shellfish Platter was finger licking good. There was enough food for the four of us. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasty. The toasted bread that was part of the platter made a great addition. There was plenty of sauce to dip the seafood in as well as mixing it with the side of garlic noodles.

Overall, definitely a 5 star from me for service, food quality, and view!

313,Tiffany B.,"This place was recommended by Hotel Zoe while we were staying there for a birthday vacation. We ended up coming here for a little lunch after our scenic boat ride. I got the lobster roll and my mama got the crab or lobster cakes ( I can't remember which one). I've only had one other lobster roll, in Texas. This roll was amazing! It was packed with lobster y'all. Great service, great drinks, and beautiful view.

314,Frank P.,"So I really don't like updating reviews unless my last experience was bad but my current experience was not great at all. So I reserved my table on Yelp for 7 people  at 8pm on 01/26/19 and I asked for the large round table in the corner next to the window. It's the only one in the restaurant.But I dont want to forget that we have had this table twice in the past. So why wasn't we able to get our reservation accommodated seeming that it was for a birthday party??? So they go to sit a party of 5 at the table but not the larger group who actually asked for it.. If I'm putting in a reservation 30 days + i would feel like we actually should of been accommodated due to the extent of the occasion. My wife and I along with our guests was unhappy due to the fact that we actually like the fog harbor due to the large table and less noise in that area.

The food was great but at the same time my sister spoke to the man In charge that night and there was nothing done about that situation. We actually love this restaurant and the staff but we feel like were not being treated like guests due to something like this. Did I mention that we checked in 30 min before our reservation and the table was empty??? Yes empty. I would hate not coming back here do to a upset wife/guests/my self. Can some one address this situation for me please.

But all in all our server #832 was very attentive.

Very very very upset

317,Jonathan K.,"We were looking for a great place to eat near pier 39 with a view of Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge in SAN Francisco. We were told Fog Harbor Fish House was the place to go. 

I have to say that the wait for a table is well worth it. We were given a wait if 35 to 45 minutes for a meal, now I know why. The food was excellent... and I don't skip to many meals if you know what I mean.

The wait for the table afforded us enough time to snap some good pics of the bay and to to explore the pier, collecting a few cheesy keepsakes for our relatives back home.

We ordered the people's choice award winning clam chowder with crab in the bread bowl and the calamari starter.

My lady said it was the best calamari she has ever had which is a lot coming from an Australian.

The clam chowder was hearty, finger licking good and substantial at that...

The best part of the meal was our super friendly and well informed waiter Miguel .B

He made us feel right at home, made recommendations on drinks and was nothing but a pleasure to be around, if you do decide to visit, ask for him by name... and remember to tip your waiter...

318,Irene X.,"Great seafood restaurant at Pier 39! At first I thought this place is one of the tourists trap but I am glad I gave it a try!
I can say this restaurant is upscale, in terms of service, food quality, atmosphere and of course the price.
The restaurant's lobby is pretty cool with the fireplace and sofa to relax with a glass of cocktail while waiting for your table.
We got one of the best seat overlooking the ocean/pier.
The server is very good explaining what to choose from the menu. 
The Garlic Roasted Whole Dungeness Crab taste very good, the crab meat is enough to make me full.
The Cioppino also taste very good, rich in flavor.

If you happen to be at Pier 39 and feeling hungry, I would recommend to stop by at Fog Harbor Fish House Restaurant!

320,Jessica S.,"My fiancé and I went in last night for dinner and I regret it. The food was pretty good but the reason I regret going is the service. Our waitress was rude, and overall very unprofessional. She asked my fiancé if we wanted more drinks, I had turned to him and said not thank you, and she sharply replied ""I was asking HIM!"" So that made me want to leave in that moment, but we stayed to finish our meal. Then when the check came we didn't leave a tip due to her being rude. 
To our surprise she ran out after us, (like we had stolen something) while we were 3/4 of the way down the stairs. She got in front of my fiancé, and was blocking his path to continue going down the stairs. She was also uncomfortably close to him , and was confronting him in front of everyone about why he didn't leave a tip. I had gone to intervene because she was in his face and I told her that she's acting unprofessional and that I've never seen this happen, I told her we didn't tip and that's that, Leave us alone. And she smirked and said ""that's on you""

So I don't know if that was some sort of threat but after spending about $160 on dinner, I don't want to be persecuted for not tipping for bad service. I don't want to be treated like and criminal and I don't want to be embarrassed in front of a crowd. I don't want my fiancé's and my safety to be threaten by an out of control waitress. I truly regret eating there now. I can't believe this even happened.

The hostess gave us a nice seat next to the window to watch the sailboats and seals hanging out in the pier and only a 20 minute wait for walk-ins.  We wanted the best shellfish tower at Fisherman's Warf, and we got it! At $88 it was the perfect amount for a nice lunch and for San Fran, the price is great. Our server, Nieph, was wonderful and always had a smile on her face. She recommended a Sauvignon Blanc that went very well with the meal we had.  She brought my boyfriend a dessert for his birthday and we truly had a great time! Overall, a wonderful experience! :)

The food was EXCELLENT. Even came with a basket of freshly baked sourdough rolls and soft butter. We were so full by the end, but the food was so good, we were mopping it up.

328,心怡,"We made reservation in advance so we got the chance to sit at the window side. That was thanksgiving night, every other restaurant was empty but there was line in front of fog harbor fish house.
The service was really attentive. We were taken good care by the waiter all along. 

We two people shared a seafood platter and a daily special scallop risotto. 
The crab was tasty but not amazing. The best part was the mussel actually. I also like the garlic butter finger potato.
There were four huge scallops on the risotto and there are more seafood hidden in the rice.

Drink list was also great.

Recommend for dating and friends gathering. 
It is a touristy spot but you won't disappoint.

329,Steve W.,"The restaurant was very busy when I went on Thursday 12/27.  We had a 6:45 pm reservation.  We, a party of 2, planned diligently to get there on time.  However we were delayed when the F line car we were riding on terminated it's trip early rather than continuing on to fishermen's wharf.  Thus we had to get off and wait for the next car.  Rather than being early we could now see that we would be 10-15 minutes late. I immediately called the restaurant to inform them.  The hostess brusquely states tables would only be held 10 minutes and then we would be put at the back of the waitlist.  This created stress and hurrying, but we made it 5 minutes late and we did get a nice window seat in the end.  

The clam chowder in a bread bowl was good.  The fried shrimp was ok. I think I could have ordered something better than this. The waiter serving us was excellent.  

The original experience with the hostess on the phone really was off putting though.  Several people on the F line overhead my end of the conversation and advised me to no show and find another restaurant.  I'm glad we made it. The rest of the staff compensated for the poor attitude by the hostess.

334,Maria P.,"I didn't have a specific place in mind for dinner while we were in the Fisherman's Wharf area so I pulled up the Yelp app.  Fog Harbor Fish House had the most solid reviews and was in the direction that we were heading in, Pier 39. Sweet!

We got to the Pier and realized it was on the 2nd floor of the little shopping area, but luckily there was an escalator (and we found out later an elevator) to get my kiddo's stroller up there.  Traveling with kids makes things a bit tricky sometimes, but getting to this restaurant is manageable.  They do ask that you park your stroller outside in their pretty little sitting area though and the hostesses will keep an eye on it for you.

We didn't have a reservation, but were seated right away and it seemed like we came in right before the dinner rush.  Perfect timing as always!  The restaurant has big, beautiful windows and our table looked out into Pier 39.  Now THIS is the way to enjoy the pier without having to deal with the wind and cold, folks. It was a cold, cold day and the warm restaurant was a welcomed reprieve.

The menu offers a solid seafood selection with specials featured on a separate menu.  I ordered the lazy cioppino (recommended by our waiter vs. the regular cioppino) which was an added $5.  I really wanted seafood and I figured this is the best way to get a taste of a little bit of everything!  My husband went with our waiter's suggestion as well -- the Alaskan Halibut which came with pearl couscous, angula pesto, and a balsamic glaze.  Apparently it's only available 1 month out of the year.

Our food came out quickly and from the moment we dug into our meal to the very last bite, we were ooooo-ing and aaaahh-ing.  Getting my cioppino ""lazy"" was totally worth it.  I didn't have to spend time trying to break the crab legs and digging the meat out which often times is frustrating for me.  I just want to eat!  Lol.  The scallops were cooked perfectly, the crab delicious, and all the flavors married well.  I'm more of a white / cream sauce type of girl, but the tomato broth was really delicious and had a bit of a kick to it as well.  My husband absolutely loved his dish.  He noted that it needed a bit of salt, but concluded that it was the best fish he's probably ever had.  As a cook himself, he can sometimes be critical of restaurants, but not this time.  Our bellies were full and praises were sung.

We were pleasantly surprised and impressed with our experience.  Our waiter was so attentive and never left us waiting or wanting.  He came out with the dessert menu, which is actual examples of the desserts arranged on a tray, but I was full and content.

I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to try fresh seafood with a great view!  You're in the Bay after all!  Just get there early as the restaurant was PACKED by the time we left.

Everything was top notch.  Server was fun and friendly but serious about our comfort.  Casual but not too casual?  Apps were spot on.  Like most FW restaurants they had clam chowder.  I recall it was a stand out though.  Entrees were fantastic and drinks were strong.  I had sole- buttery, flaky, done just right.  Great spot for a fun night.

It was near the pier side so you could look out and see the pretty water and seals chillin.

The restaurant was a bit pricey which is expected for a seafood place in a good location! It was quite fancy inside. I just went during lunch but I am sure at night it would be even better. I would recommend it if you are in that area.

For starters, my bread plate was dirty and had crumbs and some liquid in it when we sat down. Our menus had food stuck to them, and my dish had some strands of fabric in it.

On the bright side, Kayla, our server was very helpful and friendly, and my crab risotto was creamy and delicious (once the fabric was removed). Also, the fresh sour dough was AMAZING. Too bad about all the other problems...

342,Richard D.,"This has to be the best restaurant we dined at in our entire trip to California. I usually find a good place to eat with yelp. I choose something with many reviews and a high rating. This was out of the park. We made a reservation for a table with a view at Sunset and we were seated at the first table because there was only a table for 6 available and the hostess said ""that is for parties of 6"". 
We asked a man with glasses if we could move there and he brought us right away. We had a beautiful sunset view and we could see the sea lions on the pier. 
The food was top notch. It is a bit pricey but so is everything in CA. It was worth every penny (or dollars). I started with the mussels fries. The fries were surprisingly hot with garlic, cheese and a bit of broth. Absolutely Yummy. I always try something I don't see everywhere else. 
Next I usually eat cioppino. It was invented in San Fran so I ordered it. It was AMAZING

Good, but pungent...as blue cheese tends to be. Be sure you get the marinara sauce, which was quite flavorful and a nice pairing.

We headed to Pier 39 for a seafood dinner-- I was worried that restaurants here would skimp on quality to cash in on oblivious tourists, but this couldn't have been a better spot to end our day. Having a few drinks + watching the sunset was divine.

Walking in at 5PM, our party of 2 was seated within 10 mins. The windows had a gorgeous view of the pier. Our server, Miguel, was cordial and made fantastic conversation between dishes.

Yooooooo I was over carbs for a min but their bread was like the holy grail of restaurant bread-- crisp outside, buttery/fluffy inside, moist & soft when cool. I wanna live in this bread forever.

LINGUINE WITH CLAMS: The restaurant was PACKED, but we were served within 15 minutes. I already love linguine, I love clams, I love white wine sauce-- of course I was a fan of this hearty dish ^_^ The portions are pretty generous; my friend and I could barely finish.

OYSTERS (6): So fresh and sweet! Not sandy at all. Just some lemon was enough to season them, no sauces needed for me.

WILD BERRY BRAMBLE: I had this and thought, ""Ok, that's DEFINITELY 99% mixer/ice and 1% alcohol""-- it tasted like a lil fruit cooler! 30 minutes later, I was drunk. HAHA WOOPS. Deceptively strong.

Also, huge props to their overall quality of service. I really hate children, and we happened to be next to two loud af toddlers who decided their paper mats were good for makeshift confetti. Idk why the moms thought it was ok to chat away instead of disciplining their kids, but their server patiently picked up the paper with a brush, took the remaining paper away, and soothed the kids' tantrums.

351,Scott M.,"Great Sunday dinner with a view of the harbor!   Appetizers were delicious - crab cakes and shrimp cocktail.   Mixed grill entree was fantastic.   Grilled shrimp, pacific cod, and grilled salmon.   Would highly recommend Fog Harbor.   The best meal we had during our visit.

352,Jennifer D.,"Ok so it went well could have been what we ordered but this was my honest opinion of the place. One of the several hostesses was just a tad rude but we overlooked it because we had a reservation.
1. Bloody Mary was great! Spicy like I love them!
2. Oysters were 100% overrated and overpriced.
3. Loved the complimentary bread.
4. Clam chowder was subpar at best
5. Server and remainder of staff were super kind
For $128 for two dozen oysters, two Bloody Marys, two clam chowders was just expecting more. Unfortunately I would not return even though the drinks were great.

353,Kymberly C.,"My god, the chowder bread bowl is every bit of magic as claimed. I stopped in after the ferry to Alcatraz to take advantage of the happy hour which was an excellent value. The restaurant itself is so beautiful, offers a lovely view of the Bay and the service was topnotch even with us clearly being tourists there to give our wallet a break.

I had a glass of house white, which was delicious & very fairly priced, alongside my bread bowl while the Hublet had the crab cakes. The chowder was absolutely on point, meaty and perfectly seasoned; the bread bowl made it a meal in itself! The crab cakes were excellent, hardly any filler, obviously very fresh quality crabmeat.

354,Anthony N.,"Have you ever wish you could enjoy a delightful meal with a breathtaking view of the ocean. There's just something soothing about listening to the waves crashing upon the shore. For many, it can be very therapeutic and a comforting experience to indulge in. Add a glass of wine and your significant other to the picture and you'll never want to leave that moment of euphoria. So if you're ever around, Fog Harbor would be the perfect getaway for this kind of occasion. 

F.H.F.H wasn't apart of my friend's and I agenda. We had initially stop by to check out the pier but ended up giving this place a try.

We had walked in during one of their slow nights of a while back ago and got immediately seated at the bar. We had a couple of luggages on us so we didn't opt for any tables. The bartender who was working behind the bar was also our server as well. 

He initially greeted himself and took our beverage orders. As my friend and I were glancing through their array of seafood selections, we both wanted to get two appetizer to share. We weren't as hungry but we were willing to see what this place has to offer. 

We ended up ordering the mussels and their award winning clam chowder bowl. They provided complimentary bread to us which was great to dip with the mussels. 

Several minutes later, our meals had came out and we both started digging in. The mussels were perfectly cooked and marinated in the white wine broth. There was a subtle taste coming from the roasted garlic and a sweet tang from the tomatoes. A beautifully well executed dish I must say. 

As for the clam chowder bowl, the sourdough bread felt as it was freshly baked from the oven. The exterior of the bread was still nice and crunchy and the inside was soft like marshmallows. The clam chowder had chunks of potatoes, bits of chopped clam and also had a rich tasting cream broth. The juices from clams and cream were in perfect harmony which provided that sweet and savory component to the dish. I very much enjoyed since I am a huge sourdough fanatic. I highly recommend this to others!

My overall experience was a superb one. Their customer service was right on the dime and the quality of seafood was worth every penny. The panoramic window scenery was definitely a experience to remember...

356,Athena H.,"Shout out to Curtis our server, he is knowledgeable and so friendly. Our food the flavor is amazing although one of two entree we ordered came a bit short. My Ciopioni came with 1/4 of the crab. I specifically asked for this dish because as I walked in I saw 4 out of 7 people that were seated at the bar had this dish, I asked for the name and that's what I want. Flavor was in point except that everyone around me has half their crab ginormously big whereas my 1/2 crab cake missing the biggest claw and 2 more claws so I had the saddest looking crab claws compared to the husband dish. I told Curtis that I feel cheated and kitchen should not have put something like that on a $40 dish, his genuine response show how professional he is, no compensation and I wasn't looking for one. Just want to ensure kitchen is aware to improve for my next meal. We would definitely come back for another meal. My husband raves about his dish, can't recalled the name but it was house specialty dish tonight of platter season served over linguini in tomato cream sauce. I tasted the dish and it surely was delicious.

357,Linden D.,"Okay you guys.. the price may be scary looking at this place, but it is 100% worth the money spent. I had the best experience with the service and even more so the FOOD. Let me tell ya ..

FOOD : okay you guys.. I have had a lot of salmon's in my life, but this was BY FAR the best. The first bite I took, I dropped the fork and sat back In my chair - straight BLOWN away. The salmon tasted so fresh and incredible, it was juicy and charred on the outside but soft and tender In the middle. The flavors swirled together in the best way. The green beans were cooked tender, they absolutely mastered the green beans and how they cooked them. I could honestly write a five page paper on how great this salmon was. Everyone order it. For real. Right now. If I became a multi millionaire this would be my nightly order. 

SERVICE : we had the sweetest server, her name was Jess, and she was SO kind. She served us so well and with such intentionality. I haven't met a lot of kind people in SF, but man, she was so sweet!! Very refreshing. 

ATMOSPHERE : they have windows all along the Bay Area so you can look all the way along the water and it's beautiful. This is an upscale dining place, but they don't make you feel like you're unwanted if you're a little under dress. White tablecloths and napkins, very boujee! 

GO HERE!! IT IS AMAZING!

I ordered the Calamari (amazing, some pieces had jalapenos in them) and the Mixed Grill (salmon, cod, shrimp, vegetables, and garlic mashed potatoes) and it was incredible. The shrimp was a bit spicy but still very good. Our server Jeremy was very kind and helpful with tips about the area. Overall, a bit pricy but the food is well worth it.

360,Mahsa T.,"Great food in a highly touristy place (which sounds like an oxymoron I know). Two things this place has going for it - it's huge and can accommodate a lot of people and fortunately the wait for a table wasn't as long as we were quoted - and it has solid food. 

I ordered the fish and chips, which was fresh and delicious. My table mates ordered a combo plate that had a variety of seafood on it - they loved it. 

I subtracted one star for service because it took so long for our server to acknowledge us and come take our order and he had a bit of an attitude, which I didn't appreciate. I hate it when servers give you attitude for not ordering a drink - it was lunch and hey listen, I only want water. You give me attitude, it takes away from my enjoyment of the food and restaurant. 

Great views.

362,Tracy I.,"Right on the Pier in Fisherman's Wharf, a touristy place that actually pulls off really tasty food at the same time. Sometimes--okay most of the time--it's hard to make that work. There are plenty of clam chowder pop up stands along the route walking here, but we really didn't feel like eating chowder in the drizzling San Francisco rain. Fog Harbor solved that issue and offered some sweet views of the bay at the same time. It's definitely a popular spot as the place was constantly full of visitors and hungry seafood diners. I stuck with the traditional clam chowder in a sour dough bread bowl. Absolutely fantastic!

363,Rainie L.,"I had high expectations of this place and had bookmarked it for awhile so was excited to try it tonight while I was in town. 
First off, this is a charming restaurant with great vibes and great service in Pier 39. No doughs about that. Our server was amazing and super awesome. I forgot her name but she was so attentive despite it being a full house. 
The food itself was a letdown. We ordered the clam chowder, half dozen orders and the seafood platter with add on lobster tail in herbs and butter. The entire meal was pretty much a miss for me. Let me explain fish by dish:

Chowder - they added bacon to it. I love bacon and yet bacon couldn't save this dish for me. It just tasted weird like they added lemon to it or something. It had a sour undertone for a cream soup but it didn't taste spoiled.

Oysters - these were pretty fresh and local according to our server. No clue what they were though but they were tiny. Decent though and my fave for the night.

The seafood platter was huge and came with dungeoness crabs, mussels, clams, jumbo shrimp, and fingerling potatoes, plus one lobster tail add on. 

The lobster was pretty bad. The texture was obviously over cooked and very dry. The crabs while a lot (and usually I'd be jumping with joy) was pretty dry and overdone. So we're the clams. Only the mussels and shrimps were cooked just right. Maybe it's because they baked this dish and over did it but I think steaming it would have preserved the sweetness and juiciness of the dish. 

Tax and tip came out to be $170 USD. Really not worth it in my opinion. Not because of portion because we were full but because it just wasn't very tasty. We wanted fresh juicy seafood in SF and instead got over cooked dry seafood that could have been previously frozen for all we know. 

This might have been a one off experience but being out of town, this was our first and def our last experience there. Again, great vibes and service just not IT for the seafood experience.

The food was all around delicious - I wouldn't recommend the risotto but my husband said his steak was good.  

Unfortunately the service was terrible, actually some of the worst I've ever experienced.  So bad that my husband actually would go to the bar to order another drink every time.  Our waiter simply would not come to our table and when he did, he would be rude, dismissive and not attentive at all.  Because of our waiter, Michael, I unfortunately have to give this place a 3 Star.

369,Jeanne B.,"If you have someone in your friend group or family who says there's better clam chowder any where in the world, tell them they're wrong. Very, very wrong. Fog Island has the most nutritious, fresh clam chowder I've ever tasted. And this is coming from a connoisseur. My favorite part is how the light, yet rich flavor. You can tell there are layers of flavor that have been meticulously built in. 

If clam chowder isn't your thing, the menu doesn't end there. And make sure you get seating outside for the best experience. Literally right on the docks. It doesn't get much better than Fog Island!

370,Meghan L.,"Wow!!! This restaurant is amazing. I was out in the city with a good friend and she recommended we go to this restaurant for lunch. I was not disappointed. 

They served warm fresh sourdough bread while waiting for our entrees. The butter was perfectly salted and room temperature which I love. I ordered the half soup/salad. I got the Cesar salad with clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl. It was more than filling I wasn't able to finish it all. Good thing I had my husband there to help me out. 

My husband ordered the Ahi Tuna entree which he let me have a little of. The Ahi tuna was seared and coated with sesame seeds but rare on the inside. It had great flavor and melted in your mouth. It was served with rice with an amazing soy/lime sauce that had a yummy smoky flavor. It was also served with vegetables. 

My friend got the mixed grill which came with salmon, cod and shrimp along with grilled vegetables and mashed potatoes. 

We all left very full and satisfied. 

This restaurant has tons of yummy seafood options. I can't wait to come back to this restaurant and test out the other entrees.

Located on the 2nd floor of the Pier 39 strip, you get a pretty awesome view, day or night. We requested a seat by the window and were accommodated with no problem. the service was good and the food was GREAT.

We started with the shrimp cocktail, I highly recommend.
My Mom had the special - Crab risotto with Scallops, she LOVED this dish. Everything was perfectly cooked. I went with the Seafood Penne, also SO good! The dish was packed full of clams, mussels, crab, shrimp, scallops...too much for me to eat on my own even though I tried so hard :)

372,Nicole L.,"As with the majority of the restaurants on Pier 39, it's over priced.  Pier 39 is a tourist mecca with literally boatloads of tourists arriving all day every day.  They can charge what they like and they do.

But of the lot, this isn't a bad choice.  I've been here several times and have always walked away happy.

I had the crab sandwich for 25.  It's pretty decent.  They don't stinge on the crab and the bread is as fresh as fresh can be.  The accompanying fries, however, are some of the worst I've ever come across.  You may want to think twice about the old fish and chips option.

I will give them kudos on one thing.  Someone at our table had an allergy and they went above and beyond to ensure her safety.  To the point of reading the ingredients of the ingredients.  So thank you for that.

Service is always good and the majority of the tables ensure a good view of the water.

I had a great time coming here for the first time. I'm from SF, and I've never been to Fog Harbor. I know.. it was time. I had the NY Steak and my girlfriend had the Cod. I don't know how hers was because she didn't share. I guess it was pretty good! Mine was great the sauce reminded me of Asian flavors. To finish up the night we had the Creme Brulee and Chocolate lava cake. Wow it was rich! The experience reminded me of a cruise that my family and I just took. Right on the water, and just a huge space. Overall, we had a good experience, and will probably come back for the Crab.

378,Felisha L.,"What a view when dining here at Fog Harbor!  We have visited Pier 39 many times but have not dine here.

Atmosphere:  What a view!  If you are seated by the windows, you will get the ocean and pier view.  If you come after sunset, viewing may be limited to city lights and stilettos of the pier.  Lightly dim wotj a relaxing atmosphere.  

Food: Even with full tummies, we still had several dishes.  First and foremost, you must get their famous clam chowder.  It was on point and one of the best!  To top ot off, they served fresh baked complimentary sourdough rolls!  We also enjoyed the fried halibut served with couscous tossed with fresh veggies in vinaigrette.  The halibut is on the rotation menu.  It was perfectly grilled and the meat was flaky and flavorful.  We also had the half dozen oysters which were okay.  I wished they had options of other types of oysters instead of one type.  

For the kids menu, we had the fish and chips.  The fish was perfectly battered and fried.  We also had the penne pasta and chicken tenders.  

We would definitely come back for the view and clam chowder!

However, a few minutes into service a large party was seated behind us and we were promptly ignored in favor of the group. This was unfortunate as I had wanted to sample a few wines and have dessert. Our server finally attended us after spending 20 minutes providing bottle service to the group and we took our check. We opted to have dessert and a nightcap elsewhere. My dish was okay, my scallops were a smidge tough. The real started of the show was my friends choice cut steak.

I ordered the Clam Chowder w/ Lobster...or crab. One of those. The clam chowder was nice and creamy. Not too thick and not too thin. Just perfect. 

My Wife ordered the Cioppino and added noodles to it. Not only that dish was yummy, it was freakin' HUGE! So much seafood!!! I would highly recommend getting the Cioppino with noodles. Perfect combo. 

We both ordered the Calamari. Hands down, the best Calamari I've ever had in my life! The outside was flakey while the inside was a very soft but chewable piece of seafood meat. I would probably come here and just order the calamari to go if that's possible.

Very prompt with checking in on us and bringing what we needed for our meal. We started off with the famous clam chowder bread bowls and non-alcoholic wine soda for the boujie lifestyle! The soup was yummy, and I honestly got halfway full with that.

For the appetizer, we ordered the mussels fries, which had a strange taste to it, but the fries tasted good with the sauce. We also ordered the ShellFish Platter, Surf and Turf! My favorite would have to be the NY steak, which I had cooked medium. It was cooked the way I wanted and the meat was soo juicy and delicious!

My only complaint was that the snow crab legs were dead cold, and the platter wasn't as hot as I had expected it. The validation ticket that they gave us for an hour of parking didn't work either. 

Our meal ended up costing $240 for everything listed above, which included tip. I honestly thought that it was a bit overpriced, but for the quality of food and service, I wouldn't mind coming back once in a while.

390,Yixuan L.,"Food: 
This is a great place to go for special occasions! I've celebrated many birthdays, anniversaries, and valentine's days here. I've always sat near the windows for a beautiful view of the water. My absolute favorites on the menu would have to be the award winning clam chowder.  The calamari is one of the best I've tried, and I'm a huge sea food lover. It's paired with fried onions and jalapeños. The dipping is a creamy aioli sauce that truly brings out the flavor of the calamari. For the entree, I usually order the linguini and clams. The amount of clams that's served is unbelievable! If you aren't in the mood for something super heavy, I would go with this dish to satisfy any seafood cravings. It also comes with a slice of garlic bread that pairs really well with the sauce. My family is a huge fan of the shellfish platter. Although it's a bit on the pricier end, it encompasses all the seafood favorites that anyone can ever wish for in a meal! Mussels, clams, shrimp, and half a Dungeness crab. 

Price & Portions:
Clam chowder: I usually go with a cup, but for an additional $2 you can get a large bowl to share between 2-3 people!
Calamari: I would say for a $15 plate, it can comfortably serve 3-4 people as a starter dish! 
Linguini and clams: Not a lot of pasta, but still quite filling. $20
Shellfish platter: ~$50 for a sizable amount of seafood

Overall opinion: 
If you're ever on Pier 39, this is a must-try, not only is the food delicious  but the ambiance is one of a kind. Service here is wonderful, the waiters really make an effort to ensure your time there is well-taken care of!

For an entree, you can never go wrong with their clam chowder. This is usually my family's go-to place for Pier 39.

398,Rod D.,"To loud for me. Had to shout at server. Server did not bring the food. Too many people bumping into me while I eat. Not fresh bread.
Had the trout was dry, very thin with hardly any flavor. $20
The clam chowder was good

The bread wasn't fresh as you can tell fresh bread.
Every 30 min would still be warm and not hard in middle. 
What about trout? Not good....is it fresh, frozen, farmed.

I came to SF for work and my cousin met up with me. He asked what I wanted for dinner and being from the Midwest - I told him I had been craving raw oysters. He laughed and said he would take me to a good place -- little did I know, he took me to his workplace on his day off. So sweet of him.

He ordered me some oysters and we went at it. Everything was delicious and clean. The oysters were so yummy and fresh.

406,Teda R.,"From the food, to the view, and to the staffs, it's all marvelous! I've been here so many times with my family because we really do enjoy eating here. It's our to go restaurant whenever we are adventuring around the Pier or craving clam chowder. I'm from Stockton and yes, we really do drive to SF sometimes just to eat here lol!

I've tried countless of restaurants in SF that serves clam chowder, and I think Fog Habor have the best ones! + adding crab meat makes it extra delicious! Is definitely worth it to get the shellfish platter or tower if you're into seafood! A great variety and nice portion. The salsa dipping sauce that came with the Shellfish Tower was to die for. It's mixed very well with the touch of crab meat too. I love crab meat as you can tell lol! I love French fries as well, so I decided to try the Mussel Fries starter and I think the most tasty thing of it wasn't the mussels and fries alone, it was the creamy white sauce they used with it. Very different but I like. 

The servers here are sooo sweet and friendly. They're the ones to lit up the atmosphere of the restaurant. I never once experienced bad service here. 

I think the only con here is the waiting. It's usually very busy on weekends and especially during dinner hours, which is when I'm usually here lol. You can either reserve ahead of time or put yourself onto the waitlist on Yelp before arriving. It really does help the waiting time to be lessen.

I definitely recommend this restaurant!

Honestly it doesn't disappoint either. The seafood is good , the service is fast and the views .. ahh the views , well that's the first thing that catches your fancy. We had a nice spot near the window , especially with the sunlight filtering in . I would highly recommend the Clam Chowder , its pretty darn good . We proceeded to order a variety of dishes Blue Cheese Garlic breads, Crab cakes , ahi tuna poke, Red Chili Garlic Shrimp and the Crab . The Crab cakes were  so soft and succulent , I wished they would never end ! Our server recommended the Hibiscus Margarita , which I think wasn't that liked by either of us , it was way too sugary .

He said the burger was amazing. You can tell a gourmet burger from an ""Applebee's"" burger because it has more flavor to it. He asked for it well done and wishes it was more cooked but he was happy with it. For me, I felt the trio fish had too much butter. Our server was amazing! Very attentive and talkative. I feel bad I didn't get her name. On the hand, there was a sore thumb in the room. One of the hostess, Yadira, did not fit into the environment. Her attire was not too welcoming for this place of business. We'll come back again in the future.

We both ordered the ciopinno. It was really good! We got the ""non lazy""style, so there was definitely some crab cracking by hand. We had to request crab crackers but it was fun. Don't order this unless you're prepared to dig in by hand. I drank a glass of wine, watched the sunset on the bay,  and thoroughly enjoyed the San Fran experience.

412,Ben T.,"Although this area screams ""tourist trap"" with all the ""I love SF"" shirts and the picture taking, this restaurant was a pleasant surprise. 

We were greeted by a very friendly hostess in front of a beautiful modern seating area. With no wait, we were seated at our table that overlooked the bay side of Pier 39. The restaurant itself was pretty spacious and seemed a little more bougie than other restaurants on the pier. The environment was very inviting, cheerful staff, beautiful natural lighting and a stunning window view of the bay. 

Greeted by our waiter, we were given some sourdough bread as we looked at the menu. The bread was soo good! My girlfriend, Cydney and I had to force ourselves to stop eating it so we wouldn't be full for our food. We decided to share two things because we weren't that hungry. We ordered the Fish & Chips and their specialty Clam Chowder in a Bread Bowl + added crab. 

Everything came super hot and fresh, smelling super delicious. Since we told our waiter that we were sharing, he graciously split it into two plates for us already. The beer battered fish & chips was delicious, the fish was crunchy and crispy on the outside, but nice and tender on the inside (esp. good with the tartar sauce) The cole slaw was house-made and was a great complement to the fish. 

The clam chowder was the best part!! Although I've been here once before and ordered the same thing, the chowder was still to die for! It was creamy, savory and just melted in your mouth. There was also a lot of crab, clam, potatoes and bacon which made it even better (I love toppings). 

Overall this is a great option for some bomb clam chowder in the bay, especially if you plan on looking around Pier 39!

413,Rob M.,"Clam chowder - 8.5. (Hog Island is chunkier and I prefer that. But this is great chowda)
Ahi Tuna poke - 9 lots and lots of flavor. Try summer summer in Emeryville and let me know what you like better 
Crab cakes - 5 not my favorite crab cakes. Over fried and the sauce is too thick 
Crab risotto - 10 buttery goodness. Big chunks of crab. Damn this shiz is good. 

Pair with the Chardonnay that starts with an ""A"". It's available by the glass and bottle.

414,Lindsey B.,"Came here to get some fresh San Francisco seafood and it was some of the best I've ever had. We had the best waiter (Daniel) who was so kind, accommodating, and knowledgeable even for being a waiter in training. He was so sweet to even recommend places to visit around the city during our time here. For starters we got the poke and shrimp cocktail and both were incredible. The fish and shrimp were so fresh, and the mango and seaweed complimented the ahi tuna perfectly. We also got the clam chowder and it was TO DIE FOR (and award winning!!) For my entree I got the cioppino which is an absolute must try. It had such a wide variety of seafood which was flavorful and extremely fresh. The broth was also delicious and went well with the toasted garlic bread. For dessert we got the apple crisp, banana pudding, and creme brûlée. All were phenomenal. The creme brûlée was so creamy and sweet, the apple crispy had the perfect amount of crunch and flavor, and the banana pudding had delicious chunks of chocolate that were super decadent. All in all it was probably one of my favorite experiences in San Francisco. I would definitely recommend making a reservation as it is a popular place, but you can't beat the Alcatraz view and the beautiful ambiance. The prices were well worth it and the service was incredible, definitely try this place if you're in San Francisco and looking for some good seafood!

415,Janet N.,"On the hunt for the best clam chowder bread bowls and I would have to rate this one a 2/5. Not bad, but nothing too special either. I came in for my husbands birthday and he ordered the seared scallop risotto. The scallops looked seared on top, but when you flipped them over they weren't quite done right so they were a bit chewier than expected. My brother ordered the fish and chips and I think his was the best option, a giant plate loaded with plenty of fish and fries, you can never go wrong with that. Our drinks were okay, I ordered a beer but my husband and brother both had moscow mules and it was very light on the alcohol.... At the end of our dinner our waiter brought out a creme brulee with chocolate powder stenciled on the plate that read ""Happy Birthday"", it was a sweet touch :)

The service has been especially great. Each time I've sat at the bar, the bartenders were fun energetic and quite informative, with great tips for food around the city.

Did the simple steak and seafood plates topped off with a couple of drinks. The ambiance is very intimate with the waiters providing exceptional service.

My friends had never tried it before, and now they're big fans.  Even when you have to wait, the bar and drinks are good, and you can enjoy the pier so it's not a long boring wait.

The go to dish at the wharf is definitely the clam chowder in the sourdough bread so i made sure i ordered that to try out and had it with a side of ceaser salad and grilled shrimp. The clam chowder was nice and warm and it was fun to eat the sourdough as you rip and dip into the chowder! It was super filling that i barely could finish half the bread bowl! The service was very friendly and attentive with the server giving menu recomendations, filling our water and chatting us up in between our meals. Really great restaurants for tourist!

423,Dorothy L.,"This place is great for a date or a nice dinner! The view is spectacular and the ambience of the restaurant is very nice and dim.

For starters, we got the crab cakes. It was very soft and yummy. I think it had a really good texture and the overall taste was pleasant. 8/10

Next, we got half a dozen of raw oysters and it was not worth the price. It was really really small oysters and I have definitely gotten bigger and better tasting oysters for a cheaper price. 2/10

I had the lobster tail and it was good but not spectacular. I felt that it was over priced because it didn't taste any different than other lobsters I have eaten before. The mash potatoes were really buttery and the beans were also really crunchy and tasty. Overall, it was delicious but not worth the price. 7/10

I also tried a little of the cioppino and it was really good. The tomato sauce was very tasty but they gave very little crab in my opinion. 

In terms of quantity, I think this restaurant is on the pricier side since it is located in a very touristy area. Also, at the beginning of the meal, they only served two small pieces of bread which I thought was strange since most restaurants give a large bread basket. However, I would come back here for a special occasion and try their crab.

424,Shirley Z.,"People always say ""Try the clam chowder!"" when you say you're going to SF, but you don't realize the plethora of options you have until you are actually there. This place caught my attention because it had the most reviews, was easy to find on Pier 39, and has a sign that says award winning clam chowder. Also, I got a 15% off coupon after purchasing tickets to the aquarium and from the welcome center, which was a bonus. My friend and I were quickly seated by the windows with a view and the service was great. They offer a lot of seatings with a view so that's pretty cool. We ordered these sliders and OMG they were so good that I wasn't even expecting it. I usually don't order hamburgers or hamburger like items, but I would probably get those sliders again. I ordered the clam chowder in the bread bowl which was also good. They also give you some free sourdough bread as well, so we ended up being super stuffed because I couldn't stop eating the bread. 10/10 would come back.

-Dungeness Crab Cakes
-Clam Chowder
-Grilled Shrimp Brochette
-Mixed Grill

I gotta say my favorite dish was the crab cakes. If you ask anyone who knows me (but don't do it cause that would be stalking, Joe Goldberg), they would reiterate to you how much dungeness crab makes me cry. It's my faaaaaavooorite and they do it justice here.

Service was great, (props to our server Justin!)  On a super busy Sunday Dinner Rush, our service was prompt, helpful, Justin tended to our needs quickly and even put on our seafood bibs! Finally, we were there for a bday and Justin kindly hooked us up with a dessert! 

The food: food quality usually lacks in these types of restaurants but not here! Seafood and meat entrees were great! We had the Seafood tower which is on the pricier sad but everything on it was super fresh and incredible and best for all seafood lovers. Though surprisingly the STAR of the show is the Mussel Fries! Whatever the sauce comes with these is an incredible mix of flavors. I've had many Mussels dishes, this seriously tops them all. 

All of our entrees (two pasta dishes, a seafood mixed grill, and a flat iron steak) were all great as well. All was finished except that my seafood grill had Sole on it which is bland for me but not their fault. Everything else on my plate was delicious.

432,Lani S.,"Let's be clear. My husband and I were probably the only two in the restaurant who were not tourists given this is located at Pier 39. We went last Friday and it is Lent, so I don't eat meat. The hub searched for seafood places and came across this place on Yelp with high ratings. It did not disappoint, and as a local, I'm glad. 

The menu said that the clam chowder was award winning, so we had to try it. It was delicious --thick, creamy, flavorful, with big chunks of clam, not like other places that use extra potatoes for filler. $7 for a cup.

My husband had the Shellfish Platter (half crab, mussels, clams, & fingerling potatoes -$39 for one) and added a lobster tail (5-6oz, $24). He enjoyed all of it, but says the one thing he'd dock a star for is that the crab was a little dry. I had the Grilled Shrimp Brochette (sauteed spinach, butternut squash, garlic mashed potatoes, $22). The shrimp were a good size, it was flavorful, but a tad oilier than I like. 

Yes, we had dessert! For him: Apple Crisp a la mode. For me: as if I'd have anything other than tiramisu. They were both very good. $9 each. The tiramisu was probably one of the best I've had-- creamy and not over-soaked w/ espresso & liqueur like many others. 

I'd give this probably 4 stars, however our server, Brianna (assuming that was her name-- it was on our receipt!), really made the difference. Add another star just for her. She was welcoming from the start, friendly, not pushy, and kept checking on us. What gave us a good chuckle was that as we were leaving, she she wished us a nice ""rest of your vacation,"" assuming we were tourists. We had a nice, quick chat w/ her and made our way out. Thanks, Brianna!

My wife and I made reservations for an evening dinner on a Tuesday night. We were seated promptly and enjoyed our seat being that every table in the restaurant faces the harbor. We felt at ease by the gracious staff and wonderful ambiance. 

We were honestly taken back by the menu being that there were so many amazing options. 

My wife and I started with the Calamari which was wonderfully cooked and paired perfectly with an incredibly tasty sauce. 
We shared a wedge salad and a cup of Clam chowder. 
The wedge was so fresh and THE CLAM CHOWDER IS AMAZING! I recommend adding the Dungeness crab!
We finished with our entree's of the Scallops w/a crab risotto, and the filet topped with Crab. Our meals were perfectly cooked and absolutely to die for. 

We wish we could have tried the dessert but our food was soo good that we ate every bite. I must say that my wife is quite a picky eater but even she loved ever item we had.

Unfortunately, I had a bad experience with a colleague...brought it to the server's attention, no resolution after a few hundred dollars spent....called restaurant several times since our visit in DECEMBER...no reply.

Decided to reach out on FaceBook (I don't believe it's constructive to publicly slam a business/service without first attempting to discuss/resolve privately)......essentially only received a 'sorry...hope you give us a try again' AFTER my actual visit to the restaurant was questioned to the hilt!  

I've celebrated holidays, birthdays, promotions, graduations, work events, etc here for YEARS.  No more...customer service apparently isn't a priority, nor is customer loyalty.

The ambiance was social and a pleasure to be around. I also drink a lot of water really fast, and he never missed empty glass (very important to me lol)

To start off, my friend and I split the iceberg wedge salad which was crisp and yummy. The Clam chowder was outstanding. Thick and creamy with big servings of clam. The Cioppino was fantastic. The sauce was deep in flavor and complimented the seafood well. The size of the scallops were huge. The penne wasn't anything special. The tomato sauce was creamy, but not too rich. And the seafood in that pasta was just as fresh as the in the Cioppino.

The Apple Crisp A La Mode was alright. If I could, I would have changed it. The crumble wasn't anything special. The apples were average, and the ice cream was the same as the crumble. 

Overall, this was a good experience. If I were to change anything next time, I'd get a different dessert. Other than that, I had a really good time.

So... I went through Yelp and stumbled upon this restaurant. Given that the wife and I both wanted seafood, this seemed worth a shot. I reserved a table online incase it was busy. 

We headed over a short time before our reservation and were greeted immediately. They said our table was being prepared right by the window. We stepped away to look down the pier and they called us a second later. They walked us to a 4 top along the window. 

Our sever was by almost immediately after we were seated and was super friendly. She checked on us throughout the meal without being too pushy. 

I was torn between surf and turf and found the perfect balance with filet mignon covered with crab. It was exactly what I wanted and cooked to perfection. The wife had scallops and risotto and loved hers also - but we both agreed mine was the winner of the evening. 

The meal was perfect and so was the service. The only thing that made the evening lack a bit of something was the desert selection - nothing seemed overwhelmingly exciting like the meal choices had interested us. 

There is a strong chance I will need to have a meal here in the future - especially if they have the filet on the menu still!

The service is excellent and what's even better is you don't have to be dressed up. I highly recommend this spot if you really love seafood and fine dining.

441,Brittnee R.,"Chain restaurant vibes but not food. We were frustrated to begin with the hostess and managers curt responses to our request not to sit by the open door (it was freeeeezing outside). The food and service more than redeemed the first impression. Adela was a gem and the chowder, crab cakes and mixed grilled were each the most amazing we've had. We woke up wishing we could have last nights dinner again for breakfast.

My friend was proposed to yesterday and this amazing staff ensured that they took care of the surprise. 

It was so fun! 

The environment is very laid back but still very nice. 

Seating by the window is beautiful! 

Midori sours here are small but delicious!

443,Regina O.,"TERRIBLE SERVICE, TERRIBLE HOST AND JUST OK FOOD.
Honestly, I wouldn't waste my time or money here - there's definitely better out there.  Don't let the high number of reviews misguide you like it did for us.  My girlfriends and I were in town and wanted to check this place out.  The seafood platter looked AMAZING in pictures so thats what I had set my heart on.  We were seated at a table when we noticed another table right by the window was vacant.  We wanted to move tables so we flagged someone down who said he would go talk to our server or hostesses for us.  We waited and waited when finally the hostess walks in and seats another family at the table we were eyeing for 10 minutes for.  When she turns around to walk past our table, she stops and smiles at us and simply says, ""sorry girls, I know you wanted that table.""  Okay?  If you KNEW we wanted that table and we were seated first, wouldn't you think the kind thing to do is to seat that family at the vacant table behind us and move us to the table by the window?  I mean... we did ask, we did wait.. and after all that, all you can do is smile at us with a comment like that?  Alright then.  That literally ruined our mood for the rest of the meal.  Shitty customer service to start off our experience right.  Anyways, our server FINALLY showed his face and took our order.  While we were waiting for the food to come out, ANOTHER table by the window opened up.  It needed to cleared still but we kindly asked our server if we could move to that table instead.  All he said was that we needed to ask the hostesses.  A good server would go ask for his table but nope, he wanted us to go instead.  If you dined here before, you know how big this restaurant is.  He can't just go ask for us?  I've been a server before and if I knew my table wasn't given a table by the window the first time around but another one opened up, I would've gone and asked before they asked me.  Well, we didnt go ask.  When it was clear that he wanted US to go instead, we said forget it.  This place sucks, lets just eat and leave.  It would've been slightly better if the food was AMAZING but it was merely just mediocre at its best.  Nothing wow-ed us and definitely wasn't worth the price or our time we spent here.  Our server forgot to give us the tools to open up the crab legs and barely checked up on us to the point all three of our water glasses were completely empty.  Again, we were full of regrets when we left.  We could've had better food and a better experience elsewhere.  Now we know.

WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.  THERES 100000x BETTER PLACES NEARBY.

444,Janice J.,"It's one of the best garlic bread we've had!  The cheese topping was tasty, not too strong even though it was loaded.  I wasn't sure what to order, so I got the seared tuna and my husband got the surf and turf.  They were both great.  I like the freshness of the tuna and the rice, veggies and soy sauce didn't over power it.  It was a well balanced plate.  As for my husband's surf and turf, he enjoyed it but he said he's had better steaks.  

You're basically paying for the location.  If you get lucky to be seated by the window, you get a nice view of the pier outside.  It wasn't a breath taking view, but it was nice to be by the window.  

I give this a 5 star because the service was excellent.  I don't know if the guy who came to us was a host or a manager, but he really made us feel VIP.  I've been to more expensive restaurants (paid by company trips hehe) and they didn't even treat us as well as this guy did.  I wish I remembered his name.  He wasn't our server, he wasn't even in a uniform.  Great guy.

The price is not worth it when it comes to the taste, but the service gives them the 5 star.  At least that guy who came to us was great!

446,Emily G.,"Sadly, they don't take reservations for the weekends!!! I came on a Saturday and thankfully we decided to come 15 minutes after they opened. They filled up really fast as they are extra busy during the weekends and during lunch time. To celebrate our anniversary, Fog Harbor gives out complementary anniversary desserts!

We got the Mixed Grill and Linguini and Clams. It tasted really good and fresh! There were so many baby clams at the bottom of my plate. Honestly the prices here are quite reasonable, and you get what you pay for. But I do wish the Mixed Grill was a bigger portion. No other complaints though!

447,Jes S.,"Located in pier 39, this restaurant is definitely worth waiting in line for. Tip - luckily you can join the wait-list (via yelp), to cut your waiting time shorter!

I had the seafood penne - with generous portions of fish, mussels, clams, and shrimp; and also tried the dungenous crab, clam chowder and the calamari - all of which tasted divine! 

Highly recommend the clam chowder!
",2018-09-02,5.0
448,Helen C.,"This place is filled with tourists, given that it's located at the Wharf. However, Fog Harbor is a great restaurant for those visiting SF and want a taste of Bay Area seafood. They have local dishes such as Dungeness crabs, clam chowder, and mussels. The interior is a little ""formal"" looking and there's a cozy outdoor patio area to wait at. There's a lot of windows at the dining room to see the views of the waters. Unfortunately, we went at night, so we couldn't get to see much.

Since they ran out of shrimp cocktail, we opted for the Dungeness crab cocktail. Fresh and great compliment to the other salty dishes we had. We also ordered oysters and crispy calamari. The calamari was crispy and an easy dish to share with the table.

The cioppino was really good. The dish has a strong tomato base and there was a good amount of seafood. Pro tip: dip the sour dough bread with your leftover soup. 

The only downside was that the dishes were very salty. I was pretty thirsty afterwards.

Highly recommend checking out the seals at Pier 39 while you're here!

453,Laya M.,"The plate looks beautiful but this is by far the worst surf and turf I've had before. It wasn't horrible but it just wasn't good. Nothing really had flavor besides the lobster & the steak had a lot of fat and was a little tough. It was my idea to come here because of the reviews and this happens to be my fav meal but unfortunately I won't be back. I love dead fish's surf and turf with crab, my absolute fav. Thought this would be way better because of the hype but it was a fail. The clam chowder in the bowl was good tho. Not fantastic, but good.

455,Michelle C.,"I came early on a Sunday.

I wanted a sourdough-chowder bowl to eat while overlooking the ocean.

First, the hostess was MIA. So I walked inside unaccompanied. The staff inside were hanging out. I asked the bartender where to go and the hostess magically appeared.

I got my window seat table. My server was so bland. She asked what I wanted to drink, if I was ready to order, and if I wanted dessert. Literally. 

Meanwhile, I'm watching the photo-obsessed foodies at the table in front of me. Their server even put on the lady's seafood bib.

So, I quietly ate my reasonable chowder bowl. I wish the top bread was a garlic-bread with butter, but it was boring bread.

Soooooo..... if you want to eat chowder while overlooking the ocean it's nice. I can't comment about anything else.

Ps- Look for the hostess outside. ;)

I thought it wouldn't be enough for me, so I ended up ordering the crab Louie salad as well. OMG, when the food came out, I was overwhelmed. The shellfish platter and my salad was huge! Everything tasted so good though. Shellfish platter was cooked with butter and tons of garlic. Seafood was fresh and it was worth the price we paid.

460,Alex L.,"I ventured across the sea (from Vallejo) for a fish house that was suitable to impress my family that came to town. They're from the Maryland area so you know they are harsh critics when it comes to seafood. I found Fog Harbor on yelp and figured it would be a solid choice for the excursion. 

Pro- it is right off the blue and gold ferry line. That's a huge perk if you're looking for an ""experience "" with dinner. Also our waiter, Curtis was a delightful and knowledgeable guy. He made the experience much more enjoyable. 

Con-it does feel a bit like a tourist trap given it's destination. It's not their fault, just something to note.

This restaurant has fantastic views of the bay and a very vast seafood menu. They make their sourdough in house (not as good as Boudin, but good) and you get some with your meal. My boyfriend and I shared a wedge salad and clam chowder. The ""award winning"" chowder didn't have as much clams as I would like and it was just okay in our opinion. Despite not loving the chowder I would definitely come back to try more of their seafood.

We ordered the chowder topped with crab meat - no wonder it's a prize winning dish. It was absolutely delicious - and they plop a heaping amount of crabmeat into it. The oysters (king of the north) were perfect. My bf loved the steam clams, especially the addition of cilantro which was impossibly balanced within the broth. I had the cioppino - it was overflowing with seafood. Service (Adam and Michael) was quick, attentive, and thoughtful. A memorable meal of our first day in San Francisco. Can't wait to come back for our next one.

472,Alexis M.,"While at Fisherman's Wharf we found Fog Harbor Fish House. On a Sunday afternoon we had no wait to be seated. I ordered clam chowder for an appetizer and we were also served sourdough bread. The chowder was pretty good considering I'm a former Bostonian. The clams were fresh and the ratio of clam to soup was very high. The sourdough bread was really good too and I typically don't enjoy sourdough. Based on the plates passing by our table I knew I had to save room for my meal so I tried to show restraint.

I ordered the Scallops with crab risotto. The scallops were large, fresh and perfectly seared. The lemon and white wine sauce they rested in was phenomenal. The risotto just wow. Risotto is easy to ruin but this one was creamy and flavorful. The sprouts in top gave added texture and the grape tomatoes provided the acid. The crab inside the risotto was from the claw which is my favorite. This crab was very fresh and not over cooked. This meal was one of the top five meals I have ever eaten. Well worth the $35 price tag.

My husband and I live in Sacramento but visit San Francisco a couple times a year and have been to Fog Harbor once a year for the last three years. The best part about this place is that the level of quality in their service and food has not wavered in those three years! In fact, it seems as though we have a better experience every time we go. We have tried their seasonal entrees as well as the permanent menu items such as the filet mignon and the food is always incredible. Even though it is on Pier 39, a very touristy spot with other touristy restaurants such as Bubba Gumps and Hard Rock, you really feel like you are at a local, upscale restaurant.

The warm San Francisco sourdough bread was a great starter. The calamari was great with the dipping sauce, but there was probably more jalapeños and onions than calamari. 

I opted for a lighter lunch with the clam chowder and Caesar salad combo. It was great. The chowder was creamy and not lacking on clams. My friend ordered the fish and chips. The fish could have been better seasoned as it was a little bland & the waiter forgot her veggies when she subbed out the coleslaw. But, overall pretty good food with awesome views.

The shrimp cocktail was just as good and the shrimp pieces were huge. Worth it. Even the bread in the beginning was amazing. Just everything about their food was spot on.

As for service, it was impeccable. Not once did we have the need to ask for something like water. Didn't need to lift a finger! They even were so kind to take both our coupons we had even though it was not allowed at times.

493,Mary S.,"Come for the views, stay for the food.

The Food: 5 stars.  I'm stuck on the Mixed Grill because it is cooked to perfection and you get a bit of everything.  I had salmon, cod and a shrimp skewer which were all delicious,  but the salmon was melt-in-your-mouth good.  The garlic mashed potatoes were awesome and the veggies were delicious.  You know how most restaurants give you crappy frozen vegetables on the side and it seems like an afterthought?  Not here.  They had green beans, asparagus, and red pepper and they were seasoned well, crispy and delicious.  Others tried the lobster, salmon BLTs, veggie burgers, oyster platter and much more.  Everyone was more than satisfied with their food.  

Service: 3-4 stars. Service tonight was great, but I have had not so great service here in the past. Although, to be fair, it was a rude manager who ruined my previous experience and not a server. 

Also, this restaurant really packs in the tables.  

*Don't get seated in the room alllllll the way in the back. It is awful.  They squeeze so many tables in there I get claustrophobic just thinking about it.  The first time I ate here with my husband they put us there and I should have asked to wait for a better table.  I was uncomfortable the whole meal - too much traffic and such a tiny space.  Not my jam.

Now, the last 2 times I came I was with 6-8 people and we got good tables facing the water in the main room.  Muchhhhhh better and more comfortable!

Ambiance: 4-5 stars for the main dining room.  Again, I wouldn't recommend sitting in the tiny back room unless you enjoy dining in a small, crowded room with no peace or tranquility.  

Overall: solid 4 stars.  The food is awesome!

As for my husband's surf and turf, he enjoyed it but he said he's had better steaks.  

You're basically paying for the location.  If you get lucky to be seated by the window, you get a nice view of the pier outside.  It wasn't a breath taking view, but it was nice to be by the window.  

I give this a 5 star because the service was excellent.  I don't know if the guy who came to us was a host or a manager, but he really made us feel VIP.  I've been to more expensive restaurants (paid by company trips hehe) and they didn't even treat us as well as this guy did.  I wish I remembered his name.  He wasn't our server, he wasn't even in a uniform.  Great guy.

The price is not worth it when it comes to the taste, but the service gives them the 5 star.  At least that guy who came to us was great!

502,Mary S.,"I came here for dinner with my husband a few months ago and we fell in love. I had the Salmon and shrimp plate and he had steak and lobster. It was a busy Saturday evening but because we had a reservation we got seated really quickly. Our waitress was very tentative and helpful, she even made great drink recommendations. Our table was in the back room right in the corner with beautiful wall length windows to our left and behind us. Although we were surrounded by people our table was so perfectly positioned that it almost felt like we were sitting alone with the beautiful romantic view. While we were waiting for our food we had some deliciously drinks and enjoyed the beautiful pink and gold sunset. Our food was amazing, drinks were nice and strong and the Crème brûlée at the end was the cherry on top to our evening. Overall I'm happy we tried this place and will definitely be returning and recommending them to friends and family.

Place was extremely loud but the guests at the table behind us were all trying to talk louder and louder to be heard by the others The place got much quieter when that party left. Watch your head on the slant beam if you are sitting in the back section.  Daughter had blackened snapper, I had mussels linguini, wife had burger which she said was great, son had fried fish/shrimp/calamari and said it did not measure up to a similar dish he ate at Cioppinis back near the antique ships pier. Date was July 20th, 2019 your place was busy so waiter time sharing became a thing.

510,Dan O.,"I keep ending up at this restaurant with family or friends visiting SF. It's the location alone that brings me back. Visitors want to see SF, and invariably that involves pier 39, or Alcatraz, or the museums or aquarium near by. I can't recommend any of it, except Alcatraz and the free arcade museum, which are pretty cool. Anyway, visitors need to check these places off their list, and if you are showing off SF, your gonna end up around here.

The views are wonderful, and after a day of all the tourist nonsense at pier 39, a sit down restaurant with cloth napkins sounds pretty inviting. Everything else is good, not great. The staff are capable but always spread thin. The seafood is good, but not notably so. The prices are quite high .... again, justified by the location alone. 

I always feel a little bad about bring my tourist friends here, as it is not nearly the best of what SF has to offer in seafood, or even just dining, but a failure to plan anything else and exhausted kids and relatives always has me ending up here. If you end up here, I recommend the chowder bowl and a beverage. If possible save your appetite and wallet for something more impressive. But enjoy the view.

A few things were missed and we would have to remind the waitress. She was nice and would apologize, but we had to remind her a few times. The restaurant is kind of upscale, most people are dressed up, but there were a few people in jeans and sweats. The wait was very short, like 5 mins but that could be because we went on a weds night. All and all, I would go back if someone else wanted to try it, but it isn't my first choice.

513,Steph F.,"The family and I planned a day trip to go check out Aquarium of the Bay and decided to have the whole Pier 39 tourist experience. We can't remember the last time we came out here but decided to go enjoy the fresh seafood San Francisco has to offer. Fog Harbor Fish House was the top of all the Pier 39 restaurant lists that I saw and that's where we stopped for lunch after checking out the aquarium. 

The restaurant was located on the second floor, across from the aquarium exit (how convenient). It's also next to the California Welcome Center so stop by there as well to get a one hour free parking validation and coupon book. The coupon book included a free garlic blue cheese appetizer with purchase of any entree that you could use. Fog Harbor also provides one hour of parking validation for the garage across the street.

At a little after 11am on a Sunday (on Pride weekend too), there was no wait. You can make reservations ahead of time online but it's limited. The restaurant actually saves most of their tables for walk in guests. The restaurant did get pretty crowded by the time we left and there were people waiting outside for their table. 

We had a table by the window and had a great view of the pier and Golden Gate Bridge. Their menu is pretty extensive but I had a chance to look on Yelp ahead of time to plan out what I wanted to order.

For a party of 4 adults and 1 toddler, we ordered the following items:
- crab cakes
- calimari
- 2 bowls of the clam chowder (+ added the Dungeness crab)
- shellfish platter for 2
- whole garlic roasted Dungeness crab

The freshly made sourdough bread was warm and delicious. It tasted even better when dipped in the garlic butter from the shellfish platter or roasted garlic Dungeness crab. Overall, everything tasted good considering this is a touristy area. The shellfish platter and Dungeness crab are good picks for said fans. Like I said earlier, it's the roasted garlic and garlic butter  that makes the difference and I'm not even a seafood fan. While the clam chowder was nice and creamy, it was pretty heavy and filling as well. I wouldn't opt for their bread bowl since you're already given sourdough bread. The only disappointing item we ordered would probably have to be the crab cakes. I wasn't a fan of the crab filling.

Our server was friendly but kinda left us alone after our main entrees came out. We had to ask about our appetizers towards the end because he forgot about them. Luckily, it didn't take too long before they came out.

The restaurant is pretty child friendly. You can park your strollers out front, they have highchairs for toddlers, changing area in the restrooms, and crayons and coloring sheets for the little ones. That alone distracted my toddler long enough to enjoy our meal. 

While I'm probably unlikely to come back again unless I'm showing out of town visitors around SF, I would recommend others to come here if they're looking for somewhere decent to eat around Pier 39. For what you pay for at Fog Harbor, you get fresh seafood, great views, and a nice dining environment.

516,Mr. M.,"Today my family and I had lunch at this restaurant and the server was rude, non-attentive and was not professional. The waiter constantly reached over my late clam chowder bowl assuming I wanted it as an entree when I specifically asked for it along the rest of my family. Then my family's entrees came  and I was told I had to wait 15 mins or so more because I could order along with my family. The calamari was only warm not hot, fried fish and chips as well as the other entree, and appetizer was not up to par as our normal experience. . I usually frequent this establishment but I think this will be the last time I will visit because I am disgusted and unimpressed with service as well as the quality of good. I would put the waiters name out however I will just keep his name concealed and hope that others will provide constructive feedback about his service to educate him on better customer. A service recovery is expected as I believe that my experience could have been better and as I was hoping to enjoy eating with my family at the same time and not separately. Also there was a number of issues with their meals however we paid our tab and hoping to get this resolved as professionally as possible with the management of the restaurant.

We tried not to order too much as we wanted to try a different restaurant (we're from Orange County so we wanted to make our way around the city), but ended up ordering too much because there was so much we wanted to try! Nonetheless, the food was great! We got the fried combo which included fries, fried shrimp & calamari, and slaw, clam chowder, and both raw & baked oysters. Everything was so good I don't have any complaints. We were seated right by the window with a view of the water and sunset. On top of that, service was impeccable. Would definitely come back in the future.

518,Maddie O.,"Wow! What else is there to say about Fog Harbor Fish House. To start, our server, Dane, was attentive, friendly, and gave great recommendations about all aspects of the menu. We began with the mussel fries, which were outstanding to say the least. The famous clam chowder exceeded all expectations. Our table ordered two items from the seasonal menu; the crab and scallop risotto, and the panko crusted halibut. Both were incredible and the fish was soo fresh. We also ordered the seared ahi tuna entree which was out of this world. Fresh, delicious, and cut of fish we had never had the pleasure of enjoying. We finished off our night with the apple crisp and the chocolate chip blonde accompanied by espresso. The perfect ending to a perfect meal. 

We will DEFINITELY be recommending Fog Harbor to our local friends, and returning upon our next visit.

Fog Harbor Fish House is absolutely in my top five most luxurious looking places I've had the pleasure of dining at. Our CEO was also kind enough to provide us with certificates / vouchers to dine here! Had a really nice experience with a few of the friendliest waiters.. while my group is not one with small talk, I noticed the waitstaff really shined with other tables whose groups were much more extroverted. It was very comforting that they were so friendly to everyone, including us, but seeing how they see and treat patrons as PEOPLE is very sweet! Not something you often see in other places. The food here was absolutely melt in your mouth perfect! I tried their tuna, sticking to what I know! Or what I thought I knew! Have never once had as awesome an experience and mouth full of flavor as before this meal! I would highly recommend this! The Moscow mule was also a little stronger than I had expected but I loved that too!

523,Raul G.,"Excellent seafood, me and my girlfriend recently stopped by for dinner on a Wednesday night. What can I say, the service was amazing and we were seated almost immediately upon arriving.

We had a gorgeous view of the bay and we could see the sun setting. It was beautiful to see considering it had been raining for the past 2-3 days that we were there visiting. 

Anyways, we started off with crab cakes for appetizers and my god! They were delicious! Nice and crispy and warm on the inside full of flavor. We were also served their complementary sourdough bread with butter which was great too. For our main course I got the full Dungeness Crab with garlic butter and roasted potatoes and a side of sautéed veggies. My girlfriend got two lobster tails with a side of mashed potatoes and sautéed veggies. The food was amazing, the crab and lobsters were full of meat and flavor! It's safe to say we got messy but it was definitely worth it.

Our dishes exceeded our expectations. San Francisco is well known for their seafood and their Dungeness crabs that it was almost a must that we had to eat crab and lobster. With so many places to choose from on Fishermans Wharf  It can be overwhelming as to who serves the best crabs in town. Well, look no further after doing a little research we stumbled across Fog Harbor as our restaurant of choice and it was the best decision we could have made. The food and the staff was excellent. We will definitely be coming back here again in the near future.

We enjoyed our first visit so much that we came again another time, although the waitress in our second visit wasn't nearly as good or attentive as our first visit's waiter.

Between both visits, we got the clam chowder, half Dungeness crab, two shellfish platters, coffee, and orange juice. The Dungeness crab on our first visit was really good and well worth the price. However, on our second visit, when we got two shellfish platters to share between us, we actually found it to be a bit too oily, so maybe these dishes are best enjoyed in moderation...

They also offer 1 hour validation for the parking lot across the street, although for our second visit, service was slow so we couldn't finish in an hour. The views are also great; both times we had a nice window seat

SECOND TIME NOT SO GREAT !!!    ZERO Stars for the WAITER!

We loved it so much we went back on Tuesday, May 28th at 6ish. This time again we got the great seat in the front of the restrurant in the round/oval area. We had a terrible waiter.  Waiter spilled an entire glass of water on my husband and didn't even apologize and blamed it on him.  As he was setting down the glass of water, he put it on the edge of the plate and it tipped over. 

From that point on things went down hill, didn't get much service and the waiter had a very bad attitude. As we glanced at the rear of the restaurant we saw our former waiter and wished we had been seated in his section...sigh.

533,JL R.,"A tourist trap in a tourist trap.

I should've known the Yelp reviews led me astray when I saw the restaurant was above a Hard Rock and Bubba Gump. 

One star for a lovely window table with a water view & friendly waiter and one star for the thick, surprisingly nice clam chowder- and that's where the good stuff ends.

Don't order their wine, even their ""best"" is not good. It's not a wine place, and I had to send my first glass back before even having a sip because the glass was filthy- some smudged black thumb print, sticky sides and gross all around the lip/lid area. 

Their shrimp cocktail was not properly cleaned and had some rough looking, discolored edges.

The salmon was not great. It was the type of thing you expect from a chain restaurant in Milwaukee. I dunno, I've never actually been to Milwaukee, but I've lived in FL, Boston & LA so I know my seafood, and this wasn't great. You know there's something wrong when the best part of a dish is the crispy pine nuts in the arugula/couscous blend. Tough, not much flavor except for the balsamic glaze charred on the bottom. Pass.

Also, the teenage hostesses are rude as hell and would rather stand around gossiping than do their jobs.

Not a place for foodies or people traveling on business-  more a joint for tourist families- but I've actually had better food at Bubba Gump.

Update for restaurant reply: I dined there on Weds. 1/30/19.

We started off with drinks which were delicious! We were seated right by the window overlooking the water at sunset Which was perfect :) We ordered calamari for an appetizer. Honestly, it was typical calamari (not in a negative way because it tasted fantastic). For the meal, my boyfriend and I split a seafood platter that came with a little of everything. We also ordered a side of pasta. When it came out, it was completely dry but the server fixed it promptly.

Melt in your mouth good all the way down to your stomach.. creamy, flavorful and also pretty filling. Then the calamari, which was not overly bready, but perfectly seasoned. The calamari was also accompanied by fried jalepenos and onions.. yum! My fiancé had the scallop and shrimp risotto which he described as being extremely tasteful and rich. I had the crab cakes (normally an appetizer, but I ordered it as my entree) crispy on the outside with delicious slightly sweet dungeness crab on the inside.

We put our name on the waiting list (45-50 min on a Saturday lunch rush) BUT we were able to grab 2 seats at the bar, first come first serve. The restaurant is very beautiful inside with nice views. Although it is in a very crowded congested tourist area, this place was a gem!

We ordered a Bloody Mary & Moscow Mule from our awesome bartender Mr. Anthony! He was so friendly and helpful. We started our meal with the Summer Ceviche and it was BOMB omg we devoured it in minutes.

Finally, we each ordered a bowl of clam chowder and paid the extra $7.00 to add crab. If you're on the fence about this just do it! Totally worth it especially if you wanna try a little bit of everything. Very delicious, creamy, satisfying in every way. I'll be dreaming about this clam chowder every day!

We come back no less than 10 minutes later to see our food, drinks and clothes have been cleared out.  The waitress says that the manager thought we left.  Really?? I mean, I know im a POC and we're in the Bay Area, but I've not encountered this in a while.

I ask to see the manager, Ken Hansel, and he says that they have people leaving all the time.  I told him I'm pretty well off and would never do that.

Come on now.  In the Bay???   The waitress was nice and gave her the 20% tip she deserved, but this damn near ruined my day.  I swear I wasn't gone for more than 10 min, and the waitress said she told him we're probably in the restroom.

The manager, after I talked to him, still had a bad attitude as he was shaking his head and talking about us to the other staff.

Management of this restaurant. Please reach out if you have any questions.  I don't complain a lot.  Look at my Yelo reviews.  They are mainly positive:  but when my young kids question what happened,  I can't let this go.

546,Yara A.,"Great experience one of the top seafood in pier 39. Great view and great service! We ordered the red chilli shrimp and crab cake for appetizers both were excellent. Grilled salmon, seafood penne and seared cod fish for entrees. All very lovely. Plates are a bit large so maybe shared entree is better.

548,Tammy L.,"The freshest seafood I have ever had in my life without a doubt! The oysters were very creamy and delicious. The ""award winning"" clam chowder lived up to its name. There is a richness to it and I love how it comes with full sized clams that are also very fresh. The seafood pasta came with mussels, clams, mixed fish and a tomato sauce. Pasta is cooked very well, everything was seasoned to my liking. Hands down, best seafood I've had in a while! I will be back the next time i am back in San Fran. I would highly recommend the Lombard Lemonade as well!!

549,Catherine F.,"We ate late evening with a reservation on a Sunday night. They have an inviting covered fireplace patio waiting area by the host/hostess podium. It rained so it was perfect to relax and warm up by the fire (who would have thought we needed that in San Francisco?!) Probably didn't need the reservation as it wasn't too pack but we sat at a window table for two that was intimate and romantic so I'd like to think we got that table because we made the reservation. 
The food was delicious. We shared a calamari appetizer and the famous clam chowder. The lemon aioli was dense an we felt overpowered the calamari. Luckily we got it in the side but I like I would have prefer a tomato-based dip instead of the aioli. The clam chowder is a must. Very good with so much flavor. We did not get the bread bowl and are glad we didn't. It looked like too much when we saw it on other tables. Could totally get this as a meal or if you have multiple people to share it with but too heavy for a starter for one person. 
I got one of the specials at the recommendation of the waiter. It was spaghetti in a lemon butter sauce with about 6 different proteins (shrimp, crab, scallops, clams etc). It did not disappoint. We came to eat seafood and I ate seafood. The shrimp was the best part of the dish. Cooked perfectly with so much flavor. He got the Mixed grill. He said it was good but said mine was more flavorful and desirable (because we always share each other's food so we can taste more things). I agreed. The mixed grill wasn't bad but after taking a bite of the seafood mix I had, there wasn't going back. There are so many great seafood places to try on the coast so I don't know if I'd go back but this is a safe choice for good seafood.

They looked pretty busy that evening too.  I liked that they had an outdoor area where guests could wait.  It had sofas and heat lamps.  

Our waiter was super helpful.  We asked if we could order immediately because our little one had to go to bed soon.  He quickly took down our order.  I think in his haste, he forgot to bring us bread.  Its okay though.  Our view was spectacular - from where we sat.  You could see alcatraz island and the rest of the pier/ocean.  We ordered the crab risotto with scallops.  This dish was absolutely delicious.  Each bite of risotto, there was a generous amount of crab.  The scallops were cooked to perfection and we juicy and big.  We also got the fish sampler plate.  This was okay but not as good as the risotto.  I liked that this was a very kid friendly restaurant.  They had crayons for kids to play with.

The hibiscus margarita is to die for and definitely recommend to those who don't want that strong of a taste drink. The top ""froth"" comprises from the egg white was a great addition to your typical margarita. 

The tuna entree (not appetizer) was also delicious. Presentation of it was beautiful as well. Portion size of tuna was great. It is rare so be warned if you're not into it. 

If you are a AAA member go go customer service in the Pier before eating bc they usually have a 20% coupon for you to use to eat there and a parking validation as well. The restaurant also does validation if you need it.

558,Christine J.,"The view here is pretty beautiful. The best part of the restaurant. The decors were nice also, made it feel very cozy and christmasy. 

I really wanted to be blown away by the seafood here, and while most of it were pretty good, the crab (my fav part) was so disappointing.  We came in near closing time and the waiter asked if we wanted the crabs taken out of the shell for us, to make it easier/faster (either it's called ""lazy"" or ""lady"" version crabs) So i thought ok, so we wont be here all night cracking crabs! Big mistake! The stuff they put on top of the dish (crab meats) were not tasty at all, crushed my SF crab dreams. 

The waiter was also extremely annoyed with our party (of 5). The entire time, we were sure he wanted to kill himself or us. Not the best service, but I can understand a little being it was late in the day/shift. But having been in the industry, you just dont give attitude of any sorts when you're serving others.  

I'd just come here for a light bite or a coffee/bear, would go elsewhere for food/service.

559,Jeffrey S.,"Great food, lovely view, fun location, a bit pricey (as expected).

Right in the heart of Pier 39, on the second floor, gives a lovely view of the piers and the Bay. It can get crowded (mostly with tourists), but even as an SF resident I think this place has some of the best seafood (at relatively reasonable prices, considering the location, and quality and quantity of food) in town. I've been to many other fancier seafood places all around SF and I usually find their portions small and their prices even higher than here!

The garlic sourdough bread with Pt. Reyes blue cheese appetizer was great and incredibly flavorful. The Cioppino is a classic and was excellent (and we got it 'lazy', which means for a few dollars more they de-shell the crab for you!) and the Shellfish platter was full of mussels, clams, crab legs, and shrimp in a lovely butter sauce.

I mean, I like garlic, but this was overload!  Too pricey for what we got :(

563,Melissa F.,"I looked into Yelp to find the ""best clam chowder"" in Fisherman's Wharf and I felt I scored by heading to Fog Harbor! The BF has had many bowls of clam chowder but I insisted that the best clam chowder I ever had was in San Francisco.

So when I was planning our trip to the bay, I had FHFH on my radar. Once we got to Fisherman's Wharf the BF and I waited for the place to open and were one of the first people there that day. Our server was super sweet and helpful. We ordered a bread bowl of clam chowder as well as the fried combo which came with fish, calamari, shrimp, fries, and cole slaw. Between the two of us the food was just the right amount of food to get us full. Our server was also kind enough to have the kitchen divide the fried combo into 2 plates for us. I paired my food with a glass of pinot grigio while the BF had a beer.

I was so happy that the BF thought the clam chowder was delicious! Now, he will be biased against every bowl of clam chowder we encounter because it will never taste as good as Fog Harbor Fish House's. The fried seafood was also yummy! We want to try the rest of the menu if we get another chance to go. The view from our table was also grand. Getting to eat with a view of the harbor is serene and adds to the experience here. If you are in the market to spend some money, spend it here and get a good seat by the window. It's well worth it.

I have to say that Fog Harbor is in the running especially when served in a bread bowl.  

Fog Harbor offers quite a few rotating specials which include Crab Ceviche with or without jalapeños, crab cakes or shrimp cocktail.  

From pasta to fish to chicken, you can't go wrong.  

Bon appétit!

566,Wells L.,"TL:DR - the food is underwhelmingly average, but for an establishment that caters primarily to tourists, this place hits all the other check boxes. Great views, nicer decor and service (i.e., not a fast food joint), and serves seafood. Crab roll was average and the clam chowder was a disappointment. 

Fog Harbor is everything you're looking for in a touristy trap restaurant. I've been told most locals tend to avoid Pier 39, and I was here with my partner who had never been to SF before, so we did the touristy things anyway. Going to Pier 39, I wanted to take her someplace that had seafood (we're literally on the ocean after all), someplace that wasn't a fastfood-y type of establishment (see flash fried everything), and something with good views if possible. All of this was found perfectly inside Fog Harbor. What you won't find here though is mind-blowingly good food, however. We ordered the crab ceviche, ""Award winning"" clam chowder, and a crab roll. 

I don't particularly like crab ceviche in general, so I won't review it. But the ""Award winning"" clam chowder was a huge let down. As we were waiting in the front of the establishment for a table to open up, they proudly displayed their award for ""Best clam chowder"" in fisherman's warf. Makes me wonder what the competition was like. But it was a bit thicker and more flour-y than I typically like, and really lacked any real flavor beyond general salt and pepper. Wished it was more creamy with a more pronounced clam flavor. The crab roll was served a giant grilled roll which was soft and buttery. The crab filling was rather generic with VERY shredded crab that was mixed in with seemed like mayo (menu said it was an aioli) and some celery. Served cold, it did go well with their fries which were solidly above average.

Inside the restaurant, the decor was very upscale casual, in that it was very upscale without making me feel I was underdressed in my khaki shorts and t-shirt. More impressively, most of the outward facing walls were primarily windows, and seats not up against the windows were elevated, so that every seat in the place could get a decently good view of the bay. All in all, the location itself provided everything a tourist may look for when prioritizing the experience over the food, and it does it well, hence the 4 * rating.

It was a Friday at 4 or so and we were seated pretty quickly. We ordered 2 appetizers. The crab cakes, which the server told us was different than other restaurants and some sort of Ahi Tuna dish (pictured) Both were delicious and not too filling. The server was really nice even though we didn't order alcohol. (I've experienced many occasions when the server seems annoyed)

The atmosphere is wonderful as is the view.

The food was also delicious. I always judge a restaurant on the rolls they serve & this bread was fresh & came out warm.  We ordered the clam chowder. I highly recommend. But I wouldn't get it in the bread bowl. I ordered a cup & then dipped the bread in it! We also ordered the crab cakes & while they were tiny, they were well worth the price.

Anyway, I am giving Fog Harbor 3 stars solely because of the food. The portions are generous but it doesn't taste great. The breading on the fish and chips were so thick that on some areas, it was more breading than fish. There weren't that many clams in the clam chowder. The highlights of the meal was the fried calamari and the free bread! The free bread was surprisingly good.

We were lucky enough to get a seat with a good view, unfortunately mid visit our servers changed. The first gentleman serving us was great, the second was so so. 

We had to order separately because we were expensing one of our meals, which meant we not only lost out on better pricing of the crab, but also all the vegetable extras. Unfortunately the second server said nothing could be done, but the first gentleman said it wouldn't be an issue. A little disappointing to get two different stories.

I always love a good basket of sourdough bread and butter, and with the view is great because we saw the pier and some seals. The seating isn't crowded and spaced correctly.

578,Annalisa M.,"My brother and I were in town for a professional convention, and I thought we would check out the seafood nearby - what better place than Pier 39 for seafood, right?  Wrong.

I am a pretty understanding and patient person, and am also an avid diner of all restaurant types - I like casual dining, fine dining, etc. - the experience is the most important.  With that said, first impressions are important - I did not have a good first impression with the greeters/hostesses. We had a reservation, and arrived promptly.  This is where the problem started (mainly, with the hostessES - yes, there were more than one - no one was blatantly rude, but I didn't feel like there was any welcome and they weren't friendly):

1) I stood there and waited for about a minute before I was acknowledged (there wasn't really anyone in front of me - the hostesses were just busy talking among themselves).
2) We sat and waited while everyone that came after was seated (well, maybe they had earlier reservations?).
3) By minute 40-ish, I got up to politely ask how much longer is our wait expected to be.  The hostesses asked for my name, fumbled for a bit, and told me ""it will just be a few more minutes"" - no sorry for the wait or anything, and her attitude was that of ""stop being impatient we'll get to you.""  Well sorry to interrupt your chat amongst each other?
4) As SOON as I sat down again in the waiting area, I was told my table was ready by another girl (not the two hostesses - this one was friendlier).  Okay, so a table freed up in the 30 seconds between when I inquired and I sat down, or was I actually forgotten about?

Total time from my time of reservation to when we were seated is about 45 minutes.  If that was the only problem, it would have been okay because sometimes I do understand that things happen - but with everything that happened leading up to that, I am certainly NOT impressed.

The good stuff: the food was decent and I liked our server (whose name I don't remember, but she was attentive, funny, and helpful - and the all the wait staff inside the restaurant were friendly).

Honestly though, if they didn't come seat us before the hour was up, I would have gotten up and left.

There is an option that has a mini creme brulé and a chocolate cake with raspberry sauce. We shared both pieces and the portions were perfect.

Half the point of coming to a waterfront restaurant is the view. So why not make a concerted effort to fill those tables first? I can understand this when there is a shortage of tables, but not when there's plenty of room and front of house workers. 

Great part is they sat the next two tables in 'better' tables blocking our limited view. A bonus was one had a noisy child. Then the best part was when both those tables were serviced before us and had food by the time we got drinks.

Last year the crab in garlic was awesome this year it was mediocre because it was a frozen grab. The tab for two was 200bucks. At that price I should get fresh crab. Fog Harbor stop perpetrating. You are selling frozen crab. The service , ginger lemonade and desert were delicious. Frozen crab is very salty and has no flavor. Next year I will eat somewhere else

598,Tiana N.,"The restaurant is inside is beautiful! An amazing dining room over looking the ocean. But with that being said, our bill was $250 for 5 people. Calamari appetizer was great! Fish tasted amazing and fresh. Side dishes for the main courses were subpar & cold. I ordered the fish grill plate with garlic mash potatoes that were cold & tasteless with a side of green beans also bland in taste and cold. There was suppose to be a sauce in my meal, missing that. One other person at my table ordered the same thing, same review for his dish.  Not to mention our server Ralphel had the audacity to give us the hush signal with finger over his mouth. Extremely unprofessional and uncalled for to do to paying customers. To top it all off when asked for our food to be boxed we were brought the to go boxes. How is a restaurant that is charging premium price, has a more formal dress code expect the customer to box their own food! Although the fish was great and fresh at the end of the day I'm paying for quality service. Otherwise I'll just eat at home! Don't think we will return anytime soon. Very unfortunate. Our server left a very bad taste in my mouth.

600,Brittany B.,"Oh how I absolutely LOVE this place.  We walked over on a Wednesday evening without a reservation and had a little wait but were fortunate enough to sit by the windows at sunset.  It set the mood beautifully.  I was on a mission for seafood and went with the Cioppino. Man, am I glad I did. The broth is complex and complements the varied seafood (crab, salmon, another type of fish, clams, mussels, and shrimp) so well! My ONLY note is that the shrimp was overdone by the time I got to it.  Everything else was tender and delicious.   I was disappointed I hadn't saved the intro sourdough rolls to soak up more of the broth.  

My guy got the cod and I only tasted a bite but similar sauce complexity and complements to the fish.  It's a pricey meal but very worth it here.

Sliced cheese on top. On the side was warm fresh sliced French roll. Altogether was delicious and filling. Great customer service. He was friendly and attentive. The day was warm and sunny to enjoy over lunch.

Restaurant was on the 2nd floor of pier 39 overlooking the pier water. If you're looking for great clam chowder, this is the place to be.

The service was friendly, gave great suggestions, and seemed genuine with their guests. I did not partake in the drinks or desert but from what I saw they looked great as well.

Now, the food.. the food was AMAZING! Potentially the best calamari I have ever had (pictures included) and the Ahi Tuna with mixed vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes was cooked to perfection. I work without question recommend this to others as well as be a returning customer in my future endeavors in San Francisco!

605,Alex L.,"Been hearing everybody talk about getting clam chowder bread bowls in San Francisco, especially near the pier. I didn't know where to go for chowder to be honest haha. Literally every shop on pier 39 sold clam chowders. I looked at yelp and the reviews and this restaurant literally was right in front of my face. No time wasted and walked straight in cause we were so starving. Literally this was going to be our breakfast. 

There wasn't a wait time at all, we actually beat the rush lol. Our waiter sat us down near a window and you could literally see Alcatraz island. I thought that was a pretty cool view.

I ordered a clam chowder bread bowl and fish & chips to share with my girlfriend. Might have been a little overwhelming for breakfast haha. The clam chowder was delicious! Very creamy and tasted very fresh. The clams were cooked just about right and definitely worth it. I think it was like only 7 dollars and it was good enough to share amongst two people.

We had the fish & chips also and it was so nice of them to split it on two different plates for the both of us. You have to dip the fish into the tartar sauce! Overall it was really good, the downfall was that there was a hair on the fries. The manager was kind enough to make us a new one and take it off the bill.

This restaurant made a great expectation on the clam chowder for me!

607,Annie L.,"I came here with a friend who was visiting since it looked like a nicer restaurant. We came for dinner and the wait was about 20 minutes on a Saturday.

The service was good, but the food was quite disappointing. We got the crispy calamari to start along with the jumbo shrimp cocktail and clam chowder. The crispy calamari had good flavor, but the fried batter came off the calamari very easily and was a little difficult to pick up. The batter was also a little too thick and hard, not quite airy and crispy. The shrimps seemed pretty fresh and it was tasty with the sauce, but I noticed that a couple shrimps weren't deveined very cleanly and had bits of black left. The chowder was decent. It had a lot of ingredients, but it was a bit too salty and thick for me. 

The most disappointing dish, however, was the main. I got the scallops and crab risotto that was on the seasonal menu. I love all of those so I was very excited about it. However, I'm not sure if the scallops weren't fresh, if it was the type of scallop used, or if it wasn't prepared properly, but it had a very strong fishy taste that was very off putting. The scallops also looked like it had been seared so I was looking forward to that texture, but they were just wet and soft. The risotto was very average and not quite al dente. 

My favorite part of the meal was the blackberry press soda. It's quite a big cup and was very refreshing. 

Next time I'll be taking visiting friends to another restaurant.

Alaskan Halibut: so yummy. It has a little spice to it but nothing that unbearable. 

Ciopinno: my husband enjoyed his dish.

Chicken and spinach: my daughter had this. It was a bit dry but flavor was decent. She said she wouldn't order it again and a squeeze of lemon added additional flavor.

Server Ashley....you rock! Was attentive but not overbearing.

618,Christigale F.,"Have been here twice - the first during crab season. I grew up crabbing/fishing with my family since I was a little girl so I appreciate few things more than freshly caught and well cooked seafood. Crab crab crab - LOVE IT SO MUCH, but weary of having it at restaurants as they often overcook it, even in the slightest is a crime for me and I just can't. Home cooked pot has always been #1 and will probably remain. However this spot has got crab down to perfection and I will attest to it being the crab connoisseur that I am!! The second visit was with a larger group of friends (not during crab season sadly) and we ordered a wide variety of dishes, all superb! The scallops were my fave that day ;). Lastly I am a huge fan that they participate in the Monterey Seafood Watch program to ensure our ecosystem stays sustainable for future generations to continue enjoy this same amazing seafood! Bravo!

The star of the show for me...was the sourdough bread rolls. They are so perfectly soft and chewy in the middle, but has a nice crust on the outside (I tapped the outside and it made a lovely sound...I watch a lot of bread making videos). I am in love and will eat anything with this bread!! 
When I envision SF sourdough bread, this is what I'm thinking of. Would love if my Sf friends would send some of this bread to me in LA.  ‍

620,Jordyn H.,"I was very excited to get some seafood while on my short trip to San Francisco. Fog Harbor seemed like the perfect spot. We used the waitlist on yelp and it worked out perfectly (highly recommend). I have absolutely NO complaints about the food or drinks! I got the fried combo & it was divine! I'm normally not a huge fan of fried food, but this was delicious, especially, the calamari! It actually melted in my mouth! My boyfriend got the mixed grill, again, another fantastic dish! I definitely recommend both of these if you go! I enjoyed the variety, because I couldn't make up my mind! We liked the food so much we even had dessert! I was extremely pleased with our food! The reason I am taking stars off of this review is because of the way the waiter made us feel/spoke to us. He seemed to be annoyed to have to come ask us if we needed anything or if our food was good. I would've loved to brag to him about how great it was, but he wasn't interested in our table at all. Instead he was laughing with the table behind us and telling them to leave him a good yelp review. We really just felt like he didn't expect a good tip from us or something (because we are younger?) not sure, but it definitely left the experience with nothing to long for. Great food, but bad experience with service. I get that it happens sometimes!

622,Natasha S.,"Came here for dinner and this restaurant did not disappoint. There was no wait and we were able to get a table by the window looking at the bay in less than 2 minutes. For starters we ordered Ahi Tune Poké. Tuna was perfectly marinated. Topped over large pieces of avocados and mango salsa. I love avocados so this was a huge plus for me. Spicy sesami soy sauce and wasabi aioli went tastefully with raw tuna. For drinks we ordered lipstick lemon drop and moscow mule. I am a whiskey on rocks or wine kinda girl so rarely ever get  fruity sugary cocktails but the lipstick lemon drop was enjoyable. I would definitely recommend it if you prefer drinks where you can't taste alcohol because the raspberry liqueur masks the taste of vodka. Moscow mule tasted very diluted and watery but they were happy to make another at our request. For entree we ordered the surf and turf which came with mashed potatoes, green beans, steak and lobster tail. The portion was large enough to share and that's we decided to do. Our server was really polite and patient  which made the dining experience even better. Overall, I was thoroughly satisfied and happy we chose to dine here.

Food is decent. We ordered seafood penne, crab cakes, clam chowder in bread bowl with salad combo 2x, full fried combo, baked oysters, and s few little extras. 

The salad was a little bit underwhelming as all of the lettuce looked just flat and wilted. The dressing was good but could've used a better toss. The two kind of huge croutons kind of confused me. 

Baked oysters were really good but too cheesy for my own liking. 

Fried combo was solid. I'd get it again but maybe just with fish and chips. Calamari and shrimp were decent. 

Crab cakes were decent. Two crab cakes the size of my palm rested next to a salad for the price was just a little underwhelming. 

Overall price for the meal for 5 people including tip ~$166 give or take some change.

I suggested the cioppino to him but he was skeptic at first because he didn't want to be let down. Luckily, I checked a yelper's tip first and a yelped suggested a linguini added. My Hubby loved it! 
We had calamari and steamed mussels for appetizer; it was delicious!!! My chowder was excellent! Our son, well he finished everything on his plate! He ordered the steamed clams with linguini.

We got a table in the corner where it felt little crowded/claustrophobic. However, it was much better when neighboring table emptied. I would have loved to have a window-side table, perhaps next time.
The crab cakes and baked oysters were delicious and packed with good flavor. Being on a special diet, they were able to modify the dish as per my restrictions. My dish arrived with an allergy tag. The salmon was great and went well with arugula and the smoky taste of peppers. I wondered if it tasted so good with the exceptions, how well it would taste with all its original ingredients. Their desserts were presented well and I was very tempted but found the courage to pass.. The service was good and we were taken care of/ checked on without anybody being persistent/annoying.

Clam Chowder lives up to the hype and I made the rookie mistake of not getting it in the bread bowl. They have great bread that they give you before the meal.

641,Shawn O.,"The Fog House was a great dinner spot to end a beautiful day out in the Bay Area. With a great view of the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz, the setting is beautiful to start. The restaurant's ambiance is very nice even though it is clearly very busy!

The hardest part was trying to figure out what to choose with the tasty menu options available!

I asked for the waitress' opinion for a starter - half a dozen oysters or the 2017 prize winning clam chowder highlighted on the menu. She recommended the oysters and they did not disappoint but......I ended up ordering a cup of the clam chowder TOO (adding crab to it) - YUM! The complimentary sourdough bread combo'd perfectly with the chowder.

For the main course the choice was the trio of the salmon, swordfish & shrimp that came with mashed potatoes & grilled asparagus. DOUBLE YUM! It was tough to pick a favorite but I'd give the swordfish a slight lead over the other two; the asparagus was grilled & seasoned perfectly too! The potatoes were not bad but didn't stand out.

Soooooo.....this was already plenty of food and most people wouldn't bother considering dessert .....until the options were presented! So many choices that looked delicious but my choice was the blondie and it was really good!

In case I wasn't clear enough, I'd highly recommend this Pier 39 restaurant option. Enjoy!

We happened to go on a Sunday and there was about a half an hour wait for the two of us. 

By the looks of the restaurant, it was clean and they were trying to tend to every customer. I really wanted seafood, so I ordered the a seafood platter. It had crab legs, mussels, clams, and some potatoes in a butter and garlic sauce. It was delicious! It was no rubbery because it was cooked to perfection. I also got one of their signature drinks, I don't remember the name, but it was a beautiful drink. My husband ended up getting the steak & lobster which he enjoyed as well as his drink of choice. We had room for dessert and I got the creme brûlée and he got the tiramisu. 

The service was fairly good, the waiter seemed like he didn't want to be there very much, but he was attentive to our needs. Overall, it was a great and romantic spot for a nice date. I will definitely come back when I visit home!

652,Eric R.,"The brutal truth about Fog Harbor is that it's an upscale tourist trap. Fog Harbor and Bubba Gump are in the same Pier.

I applaud Fog Harbor for having a terrific atmosphere, View, and solid service.

However the real letdown and surprise here was the Bland Taste of the food for such high prices. The wife and I both got shrimp dishes and at the end of the meal we were really disappointed in the flavor. We both commented that Bubba Gump's had more flavor, larger portions, and was cheaper.

If you go here go for the oysters and lobsters, no shrimp.

653,Inci A.,"Seafood with a view - if that's your thing!

Came here with a friend who was visiting from out of town. Since her hotel was steps away from Pier 39 - I suggested that we go to Fog Harbor. Since moving to San Francisco, I have heard that this place was good so I thought why not :) I'm not much of a seafood person, so I love when places offer different options - and they do!!

I enjoyed a grilled chicken with veggies and mashed potatoes and my friend enjoyed a shrimp & fettuccini (this wasn't even on the menu! our server was kind enough to substitute the clams with shrimp).

Overall very nice place. The ambiance is great. The view is beautiful and the drinks are tasty.

Great place to take out of towners so they can soak in the glory of the bay and have some good food.

We got the mixed grill, calamari, clam chowder bread bowl, steamed clams and the tiramisu and blonde brownie for dessert. Will definitely come back soon.

657,Emily D.,"They have views for days here but I wasn't a super fan. I grabbed a seat at the bar and ordered a Riesling, my favorite. After ordering and tasting it, something was off. I asked the bartender since the taste was so different than what  used to and he said that they don't offer a traditional Riesling and it isn't very sweet. Fine, but I feel like you should mention that upfront and not after I order and really don't like my glass.

This place draws an interesting crowd, including people into their golden years and 21 and 22 year-olds. It's a very interesting mix. 

While I didn't order food, I checked out the menu and it's a bit pricy, but I can't speak to taste or quality.

This is a place I would visit for one cocktail and leave to off for a nice dinner somewhere else.

661,Gary B.,"It was our Anniversary this evening ,we had 
a wonderful evening there 2 years ago for our  first year anniversary, so we decided to return thinking it would be a wonderful thing to experience again .

Well I must say things have certainly changed . I made a reservation a week in advance online which is  the way to make them now @ Fog Harbor ,  all online , and when you do make the reservation , down below it ask you for any specific requests, the only 1 request we had was to get a view , table next to the window , that's what you do when dine at a beach or ocean front restaurant right ?? 

So I requested it , we showed up tonight I gave my name he saw the reservation , the man was a bit arrogant, I told him we  requested a table next to the window it's a special night ""Anniversary "", I said , he said I'll see  what i can do , I said well , I made reservation, and It was in the reservation, to have window the only 1 thing we wanted , he said no guarantees , he said walk in's get priority over reservations , then he said I'll see  what  I have  , we sat down waited  there for a few minutes,   then he ask me to follow him and he will show me to alternative options , then he did , which were terrible !! A table in the back with a view of the wall ,as well as a  booth the seated  4 people ! , I said forget it !! We just left !

I was furious, my wife was much more calm ,bless her heart , it was  our night and they didn't even really try to accommodate us ,  we wasted time going there , why make a reservation, if it does guarantee the thing you are looking for , we will ever go there again the guy was a arrogant, ass , no help nothing , terrible!  

 So never again for us ! There are better places around for sure , we just wanted to share our experience with you so you know how it can be there . Your reservation doesn't mean anything there other then to get in the place , walks ins have priority !! Ridiculous!

We started off the meal with their award winning clam chowder, mussels fries (shallots, fennel, sambuca cream, garlic aioli), and two 5-6 oz lobster tails (oven roasted, served with drawn butter, sautéed vegetables and mashed potatoes). Those mussel fries never disappoint! Drenched with creamy mussel sauce, packed with umami flavors. Lobster tails is always 10/10. Then we ended the meal with a blondie sundae (chocolate chip style brownie square w/ walnuts, topped with vanilla ice cream, biscoff cookie crumbles and a sweet caramel drizzle). For drinks, we got the Lombard lemonade (SVEDKA raspberry vodka, black raspberry liqueur and fresh squeezed lemonade). Absolutely refreshing on this hot SF day!

The location is awesome on pier 39 at Fishermans Warf on the Embarcadero with a stunning view of the Harbor. The location managed to awaken memories of my 1st trip here as a young teenager. The destination is the best its ever been, at least what I remember it to be. Best clam chowder ever! Dessert was Apple Crisp with a small scoop of ice cream on top. Prices are reasonable.

The service here was great as was the menu selection. I ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna. Pretty good. Our guests were happy with thier selections as well. I am already looking forward to my next visit here. Be sure to call ahead for reservations.

668,Thomas G.,"Came for some seafood because of good reviews, but was definitely disappointed.

Food: 
ordered seafood platter for 2 for $70 and added garlic noodles for $5. Seafood includes a half crab, shrimp and some mussels. Taste is okay but not worth the price. The noodle was at the bottom of the plate and was stuck together, probably because it was prepared a long time ago.

Also ordered crab cakes seeing all the good reviews. Taste was nothing special and portion smaller than expected. Clam chowder tastes alright, but still not that special.

Service: 
 
Waiter took away our unfinished dish without asking twice. When giving the check, he also asked directly how much I want to tip. I told him I will fill it out myself. Both practices are rude and unheard of.

3 of us spent $45 each. Definitely not coming back.

This was our first trip to San Francisco, and great food is pretty easy to come by... especially seafood, but again this restaurant shined in a different way. One dish that stood out more than the rest was the french fries tossed with steamed muscles laying on creamy sambuca sauce, then drizzled with garlic aioli. Wow! We had never eaten anything like it, and the sauce was divine. If I could reccomend anything to anyone from the menu it would definitely be this. Everything else was absolutely delishes, and fresh so you can go wrong here. Our server was top notch, and the view was beautiful.

676,Paul L.,"Dear Foggy,

I am glad I found you. My good friend yelp let me know I should check you out, so I did.

I was looking for a place to take my in-laws, somewhere nice, somewhere where the food is distinctly San-Francisco-like, and of course the food has got to be good. You hit the mark.

I don't dish out 5-stars lightly, but I'll give it to you. If the prices were like $5 cheaper and the seats a little farther apart you would be perfect, but hey I understand. If I was running a business at such a prime location and brimming in the seams, I would have done exactly the same so I can't hold that against you.

To keep it simple, your service good, your people are nice, and the food is fantastic. The highest compliment is that despite your prices, I've returned yet again, with my own parents some months later. We even got seated right next to the window and when that happens it's like magic. Also the wait was never as long as it seems for a place so busy. I would have expected to wait 45minutes to an hour but somehow it ends up being way short of that each time.

As for the food.

Mussel Fries (5/5) - um yes please. what is in that sauce? yum.

Seafood Penne (4/5) - very good. I don't order pasta much because I am not a big fan of pasta so this is a high compliment. pasta lovers would have a field day.

Clam Chowder (5/5) - yeah people might have different opinions but I am firmly in the camp of ... this is really good clam chowder. flavorful, little chunks of meat. Usually I leave clam chowder places wondering if they just opened a can of campbell soup. This ain't one of those.

Seared Scallop Risotto (5/5) - oh yes. yes. very delicious. expensive but delicious. wish there were more scallops, but those scallops that were there... delicious. 

You have become our go-to place to bring people we want to take out to the city to see pier 39. great job.

until then...

681,Athena C.,"When my supervisor asked me for food suggestions for the team outing, of course I decided to go all out on seafood by the bay. It's right down the street from our entertainment, SF Dungeon.

We made reservations for 5:00pm but our show ended much earlier (3:00pm). Instead of walking around or hitting a bar for 2 hours, we went to the restaurant to see if we could get seated early. When we mentioned our reservations, the lady at the front desk was all ""Soooooo you came now...?"" Obviously? But there were TONS of open tables. Who eats at 3:00pm??? But I bet if we actually arrived at the time of our reservations, we would've gotten a table by the window. Kinda disappointed about that but not the restaurant's fault.

A coworker and I went directly up to the bar to order drinks because we wanted the drinks on a separate tab. I got the Lipstick Lemondrop and he had the Alcatraz Escape. Both were great. Couldn't taste alcohol at all but definitely felt it. I LOVE that.

I got the Cioppino. At first I thought about getting the Lazy Cioppino (no shells), but part of the fun of seafood is eating with your hands! The scallops were HUGE! Do you see the chunk of white on the right of my picture?? That was one of the scallops!! The crabs were already cracked so it was easy to get the meat out. They provide the cracker and a tiny fork but I didn't need it at all. The fish they used was SALMON, my favorite! The tomato soup was DELICIOUS with chunks of tomato in it. $34 for all that? I'd say it was definitely worth it.

I also tried some of my coworker's Lobster Tail, which I was also contemplating but my Cioppino was DEFINITELY the winner. The Lobster Tail was way smaller than I expected, and kinda dry. The melted butter didn't help very much with flavor.

We wrapped it up with dessert. I thought the way they present dessert was VERY smart. They have all their desserts brought to you on a tray, then they introduce each one. I asked our waiter what he recommends personally and we ended up with two: House-made Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee and Strawberry Shortcake. The brulee was good, but the shortcake was better IMO. Super soft shortcake with whipped cream and fruits drowning in syrup. Not SUPER sweet either.

The only thing I regret now is my coworkers knowing how much I eat...

682,Qushandia H.,"They have the best Clam Chowder that i've ever had, hands down. Like, I'd go here just for the clam chowder.
I've been here twice.. First visit, We sat in the main room, lights are pretty dim, low restaurant music playing.. really nice but not too fancy restaurant. Cute date spot for sure! Our server was great, he actually took the time to talk to us, ask what we like and made some suggestions. I ordered the shellfish platter for one. I enjoy it. Could have used a little more flavor but that's probably just me lol.. next time, i'll just ask to add garlic butter over the top.

The second time I sat towards the back of the restaurant, ""upstairs"". I ordered the Garlic Roasted Whole Dungeness Crab (ask for extra garlic butter, if you like a lot like me), which came with veggies and small roasted potatoes. That was definitely a plus because at any other restaurant i've been to an ordered a whole crab, it just comes with the crab.. nothing more! The price for that was $45.. about the same as most places on the pier but felt more of a win because it came with sides.

Fog Harbor has to be my favorite restaurant on the pier, so far. From the restaurant set up & feel, to the servers, food, & scenery. I highly recommend giving it a try.

684,Robert M.,"Came here a little later in the evening to get a solid dinner with a nice view, and thought this place would be overrated. I must say, I was not disappointed. 
While expensive, it is worth it. The ahi poke with wasabi aioli is the perfect mix of sweet, salty and fishy, balanced well with the hearty slices of avocado. Our waiter said this was his favorite dish too. The surf and turf is a great dish to split if you're not too hungry.  We got our steak medium-well (my date's preference) and the meat was very evenly cooked and still very juicy. The lobster tail was buttery and had just the right amount of firmness to the texture. The drinks were average, with my date's lipstick lemon drop being sweet enough to mask the alcohol, and my Moscow Mule being a little watery. We asked for the Mule to be sent back, and the waiter was happy to oblige. 
I must say, I had a hell of a time trying to find parking in this area, so I definitely don't recommend that mode of transportation to get to this restaurant. My date and I did not have to wait for a table because we came a little later. Definitely will come back if I am in the area.

1) Clam Chowder Bowl: A-MAZING! I could've inhaled it in 3seconds if I was alone at home
2) Crab Ceviche: 2/5. What chips were those? Doritos? And ceviche had barely any flavors, very blend.
3) Garlic Crab: From the looks of hubby destroying it without talking... I'd say it was great
4) Scallop Risotto: Delicious at first.. but it was SO buttery that in the middle of eating it, I started feeling queasy (Maybe it's because it was my first meal of the day?) I tried to down the Bloody Mary to feel better but each bite made me feel sick more. If you're into all that butter/grease, go for it. The flavor is phenomenal, scallops just melt in your mouth. 
5) Bloody Mary: I love the tall skinny glass! It was well made, yum!
6) Off the kids menu- Pasta w/ broccoli: Literally looked like someone boiled the pasta & sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top of it. Terrible. Broccoli was too hard to chew for my pre-toddler. My son didn't even eat one bite. Waste of money.

 - unless you invented chowder in 1673)...Ahem, For spot on Seafood classics with all the ambiance of a classic San Francisco establishment, Fog Harbor delivers!

Really good crab cakes (balanced by a bright mango roasted red pepper/arugula salad). Cleaned, picked, immaculately chilled U grade prawns. Smackin clam and bacon loaded chowder (celery/parsley notes). Wedge with lots of bacon and veiny blue, nice bright heirlooms.

My dear lobster tails were incredibly sweet and not over cooked. My guest had the cod which was a highlight dish - perfect sear and to-die-for white bean 'cassoulet' (really the best dish of the evening).

Desert was an over the top blondie topped with Carmel sauce and vanilla ice cream (whip, Carmel cookie crumble, walnut, mint leaf). It was good, rich as hell, but not great.

The wine selection expensive but expansive. Service was good (and I know how hard they are working). Dinner was overall amazing; just the classics, respected and not pretentious. Yeah so what I'm local. Born and raised, and we really enjoyed sneaking into a 'touristy' place that doesn't get so many locals. GM was on his toes seating guests, hustling!

I told her no, then she said that I should have requested for a party of five. The two hostesses then gave each other a smirk whispered loudly among themselves that we are dumb. Totally unprofessional! If it wasn't for my baby, I would have pick a fuss with them. I supposed that they are either born this way or they are not taught how to serve guests.

698,Monica C.,"The first time I came here was when I was a young child and it's still as great as I remember. There's absolutely nothing I would complain about Fog Harbor Fish House. The food, the ambiance, the view, and the service are all impeccable. 

My friends and I came around dinner time so we got the opportunity to catch a view of the gorgeous sunset even though we were seated closer to the back and further away from the windows. 

We shared a fried calamari appetizer which came with yummy tarter sauce. We squeezed lemon all over it and our enjoyable dinner commenced. 

Clam chowder is a must try when you're touristing in Fisherman's Wharf. This spot truly has 'award winning' clam chowder. The clams taste as if they were just picked out of the ocean and thrown into the soup. 100% fresh. 

For my entree, I chose the Linguine and Clams and found it to be light yet exploding with flavor. I slurped up every single noodle loudly and proudly! (In Asian culture, eating loudly is a compliment to the food and represents how much you're enjoying it!) My only wish is that the portion was a tad bigger. 

Our waiter was one of a kind! One of our friends was visiting from Japan and it was his first time in San Francisco and I'm sure due to our personable waiter, he has a wonderful impression of the city.

699,Crystal C.,"Don't turn your nose up at this seafood restaurant in the thick of the tourist trap.  It's not kitschy, their seafood is solid, consistent, fresh, and the service is warm and friendly.  While the variety on their menu is appealing, I always end up going w/my old favorites, a dozen raw oysters and the seafood platter.  If you like garlic and fresh seafood, the seafood platter is the way to go--dungeness crab, shrimp, mussels, clams, and potatoes steamed well and lightly swimming in a butter/garlic sauce--and the sauce is surprisingly light and doesn't congeal and make you feel gross about yourself once you finish the plate.  I've also had the caesar, which is executed well--simple and with homemade dressing.  The wine list is brief but well-chosen.  And the best part?  You can get on the waitlist w/Yelp!

700,Bill C.,"On a long weekend in SanFrancisco and we took the Hop-on/Hop-off bus tour of the city today. Got off at Pier 39, jammed with tourists, and luckily found two seats at the bar at Fog Harbor Fish House. Since it was around 2:30, we decided to have our big meal then and we are delighted we did. Red  Chili Garlic Shrimp, a Cesar Salad swimming in cheesy dressing and anchovies, Pacific Sole, pan-seared and nicely sauced, and a couple of 8-ounce pours of local wine. Outstanding service from bartenders who clearly enjoyed their jobs and our company. Highly recommend.

I ordered the seafood penne which was delightful very nice flavor all the different seafood complimented  the sauce making the dish delectable. The drink was amazing as well and if they seat in the correct part of the restaurant you'll receive a great view of the golden gate met with the delicious taste of seafood. Will definitely be paying another visit pretty soon.

703,Christine P.,"A couple of weekends ago, my kids, parents and I decided to take in the sights and play tourist in our city.   We went to the aquarium, hung around Pier 39 and my mom suggested we check out Fog Harbor Fish House.  We had no reservations but for our party of 5, the wait was not long at all.  They seated us within 15 minutes and we were given a table right next to the window.  Service was average - not outstanding but not bad either. Our waiter was nice enough.  We ordered the calamari to start, I ordered the kids cheese pasta for my son and it was pretty bad.  The calamari was cooked well and a great way to start the meal.  We were also given tons of bread and butter.  

My parents shared a huge fried seafood platter and even had leftovers between the two of them.  I ordered linguine with clams which was just Ok but the calamari made up for it. 
I took Andrea's tip and was able to grab a 15% deal for Fog Harbor from the CA visitor center right next door. 

They have a wonderful selection of seafood and next time, I will probably order one of their seafood platters and share with my friend or husband.  Definitely recommend since they have a wonderful ambiance, food is good and the view of the Bay is gorgeous.

Down side....waited forever for our food. We were a group of 7 but we waited for an hour and we were starving and then he brought my meal out wrong and didn't really do anything to make up for it. Little
Annoyed about that. It was $19 for my burger. It was just okay. But apparently it was their ""special"" burger and that is a lot in my book for a ""special"" burger. Would I go back? No

After the soup, We ordered the local special since it was crab season. The seafood was plentiful and delicious. Would come back again. The service was great and expedient.

711,Gina D.,"I went  to Fog Harbor on this past Sunday. I am in San Francisco native born in raised so this is a very honest review. The ambience is very nice and it's decorated for Christmas which is nice. I got the servant turf and I also had the sliders with my cousin for an appetizer. I had a glass of wine and everything was good. As far as the steak it's self it first came with a peppercorn glaze so be warned. I did not like it and asked the waiter if they could make me a regular steak. It was good. But it was nothing to rave over. I probably wouldn't come back because of the caliber of the food. For me it was just OK. But the ambience is nice and I understand if you are a tourist it's a great place.. I would spend my money at Ruth Chris, Morton's, or Osso steakhouse though if I'm going to go that way again. Our server was good no problem there. But definitely make a reservation because if you don't you're going to be waiting for a while.

Our waiter was sassy, but professional, and honestly the only complaint I have was the fact that the oysters were extremely small and had a rather dull taste. I had the lobster tails and if I ever had the heart to spend $49 on one meal again, I'd definitely reorder. Had the apple crumble for dessert, it was on point! Came with my family and we ended up spending a bit more than $300 total, but it was $300 well spent. I'd definitely recommend for seafood lovers, but just a tip don't get the oysters... they are rather unappealing.

715,Shannen R.,"Two words: Tourist Trap.

Located in Pier 39, Fog Harbor Fish House sits on the 2nd Floor amongst many restaurants. It's outdoor waiting area is relaxing, spacious, and modern. It felt like I was sitting on a daybed in Hawaii and my parents can second that. 

Fancy? Yes. Pricey? Sure. Food content? As Yelp suggests, it is A-Ok.

I took my parents and siblings out to eat and only waited for 10 minutes to get seated. For a Monday afternoon, this place was already busy. Our host led us to our booth overlooking the pier and boy was that a treat. 

The menu was extensive - there was so much to choose from and it really was hard to make a decisions of what to order (Oh, decisions, decisions)

Steamed Clams - A plate of clams with yummy red sauce and corn. It was a little salty for my taste but my parents loved it!

Clam Chowder - Cup vs. Bowl - What should you get? Well, my sister and I ordered the cup size, which really is a size of an espresso cup. It was good enough to fill that clam chowder craving. My mom had the bowl. We all concurred that the chowder tasted pretty bland. Our waiter even forgot to give us crackers - whomp! 

Salmon - Yes, you've read that right. The plate is called Salmon. My dad enjoyed it and could barely finish it. He gives it 4 stars.

Cioppino - Oh what a small name for a mouthful of food. So there was crab, fish (not sure what kind), shrimp, clams, scallops and mussels, stewed in a seafood tomato broth. It was a little salty for my taste  and needed so much water to wash it out. 3 stars

Shellfish Platter for two!: Mom and sister had to share this one out. They barely finished the whole plate. This platter actually tasted better than the Cioppino. The garlicky flavor was great and it kept wanting me to eat more and more of it each time. 5 stars.

Surf and Turf: Brother wanted some meat so he settled for this. He demolished his steak and lobster but says his veggies and mash potatoes were gross. 4 stars.

Drinks:

The  ""Perfect Hibiscus Margarita"" was really perfect. It was beautifully decorated and STRONG. My dad even tried it and got tipsy with this look deceiving drink. 5 stars. All that for $13.50? What a steal.

My dad's Lombard Lemonade was a refreshing drink. Again beautifully decorated and well worth the price.

Large portions, beautiful plates, and bomb drinks. And would you take a look at that seafront view?!

So why three stars?

Well, the food was A-Ok. It sure wasn't bad but it definitely didn't blow me away either. Solid 3 stars.

717,Michelle T.,"We recently took a road trip up to San Francisco to celebrate my husband's birthday. Since he's the planner in this family, I gave him the task of finding a  restaurant that had strong reviews. We wanted something that was unique to San Francisco with a heavy emphasis on seafood selections. We don't eat mammals and our diet that is pretty much that of a pescatarian/vegetarian. 

What baffled us was that we booked our reservation via OpenTable a couple of months in advance. What we noticed was that their reservations were booked ahead of time and that we needed to secure a spot right away. So we set it up for the two of us a couple of months before we even arrived.

Fog Harbor is located at Pier 39, right off of The Embarcadero. It's on the second level of the shopping district, at the top of the stairs. This is an ideal location because it's right at the entrance to Pier 39 so you can't miss it. There are other restaurant chains there but when you travel, you want something different from what you already have back home.

Anyway, I didn't know that my husband's coworker would be joining us for dinner. So I called Fog Harbor and asked if it would be ok if I added one more person to the reservation. They said that it was alright. However, I wasn't aware that his coworker was also bringing his mother and brother who were visiting from New Jersey. Now we were faced with a situation!!!  The initial reservation went from 2 to 3 people and was now at a total of 5 people. So I explained the situation to the hostess and she gave me that look that a teacher gives their students. It wasn't good BUT she gave us the option of waiting for a table to open up OR be seated at one of the elevated tables away from the window. We were hungry so we went for the second option. As it turned out, we still had a nice view of the water as well as The Golden Gate Bridge.

The menu has a heavy seafood emphasis which was right up our alley. I was tempted to try to swordfish fish but I was more intrigued with the Pacific Sole. It was served on a bed of spinach and fingerling potatoes. This was one of those cases in which the food tasted as good as it looked. The sole was delicious and melted in my mouth. The texture and flavor were ON POINT!!!! Everyone else at the table had high regards for their food as well. 

My husband's coworker stated that he's never had swordfish before. With this being his first serving of swordfish, he said it was amazing. He's now hooked on it and won't pass it up when it appears on any other menus in the future.

I really appreciate how flexible the staff were at Fog Harbor. I was nervous about showing up with 3 extra people, given that we had to make this reservation so far in advance. Our entire experience was pleasant and I can see why this place is popular with locals and tourists. It looks like we've got a new favorite location to visit when we're back in The Bay Area!

723,Laurel L.,"The service was excellent to say the least. Rarely have i seen a waiter this devoted to a table despite the restaurant being so busy with holiday guests (memorial day).  I regret not remembering my waiter's name to put it down here, but he was a tall white man with peppered hair and at least one small silver earring. I think he noticed my guests didn't speak English so in addition to the text-only-menu, he brought over a special menu with pictures - my Chinese friends were so grateful. Being chinese, we ordered hot water with our food. Not only did he NOT judge us by our choice of drink (this happened at Market Steer Steakhouse in Santa Fe, NM), this waiter went above and beyond by regularly filling our cups and tea pot with hot water. He even noticed that leaving the tea pot lid open meant we need a refill. He explained how to use the bibs + waste bowls for our shellfish and even helped my friend put it on. However, at the end of the meal, my friends fought for the bill but didn't understand how to tip despite truly appreciating the service. I didn't feel right making them pay more, so I opened a second bill to add to his tip. If any managers are reading this, I'm using a pen name here. The table should have been under ""Jane F"".

We ordered the clam chowder, shellfish platter with garlic noodles, and the mixed grill. For the food itself, I would have given this review 3.5 stars because the fish from the mixed grill was only ok. The shrimp, shellfish, noodles, and potatoes were good and the clam chowder excellent.

727,Nicole L.,"It was okay. The blacked fish was a little too strong in blackened flavor to really enjoy the fish. The main reason this restaurant is getting 3 stars is because they use iceburg as their lettuce in the crab meat salad. ICEBURG. I would expect this a small timer restaurant but this is a top 5 restaurant in sf place. Our group paid $30+ each for two of these things. I wish I took a photo. It was such a weak salad. And in a square plate with the dressing on the side with no room to move anything without it falling off the sides of the dish. It was just not physically possible to eat this salad with grace.  The mussel fries were super salty. I tried dipping fries in the sauce a few times and I just couldn't more than three or so. Baked oysters were also salty. Eh. I get it. It's a restaurant in the pier and in the middle of all the hustle. A place to say I've been there not a place to frequent.

The service has been reliably good as well.  They are clearly going for an upscale experience and the times I've visited they've hit the nail on the head.  

Again, it's a touristy place, so Pier 39 is the right place for Fog Harbor.  If that's what you're looking for, you're in the right place.

741,Sarina J.,"Food is pretty good, but is HEAVY. Like I still feel the clam chowder in my stomach, writing this days later. Had to knock down a star for some service issues.

Due to traffic, we barely made the 10-minute cutoff for being late to our reservation. However, we sat for a good 10-15 minutes ignored by at least 3-4 staff members, including who we would find out to be our actual waitress. Just a little after opening, it was busy but not chaotic, and we got one of the last booths in the middle facing the water. However, no one stopped by to offer water or anything for these 10-15 minutes. When our waitress finally came to get our orders, she was a little sarcastic in her tone when we asked about possibly adding linguine to the cioppino, saying she had to check on it before she walked away. Ooookay? However, her attitude adjusted quickly when she came back, and was extremely accommodating and polite afterwards.

As for the food, like I said, it was heavy. We order the mussel fries to start, which were quite tasty. The broth was rich, but good when you dipped it in the sourdough. I wish the fries were served on the side or something, as well as the aioli put on the side rather than drizzled on top. We couldn't squeeze the lemon on the mussels before finishing the fries first. But everything was cooked well.

For my entree, I got the clam chowder and Caesar salad combo, but could barely finish half of the clam chowder. My family enjoyed the cioppino, ahi tuna, and seafood penne. I picked off their plates, and the seafood penne would be my favorite! The tomato cream sauce was hearty but not overwhelming and the dish had a lot of seafood in it. The cioppino was slightly too salty for me, but anything goes with that delicious sourdough you get for free! The sourdough isn't too sour, but has a more subtle flavor than most sourdough breads I've had in SF. Pretty good! When in doubt, DIP THE SOURDOUGH IN YOUR FOOD.

749,Andrew P.,"Had a great brunch here yesterday. We ordered a seafood tower and their award winning clam chowder.  Everything came out quick and was well prepared.  Service was good and we were seated right away at opening.  We had a reservation via Open Table although we didn't need it but it's always good to reserve just in case with popular places like this. The view of the bay overlooks the GG Bridge and Alcatraz Island.  I would recommend this place if you like good seafood.

750,Thesa Q.,"If you're looking for value for money, you've come to the right place! We got the calamari,  steak & salmon & they were all scrumptious. The calamari did not have any ""fishy"" smell & was crunchily chewy. The salmon was cooked about right & went well with its pearl couscous, pine nut & tomato relish side. Oh and the steak was cooked to perfection! First time to try medium rare & I liked it. We like the resto so much that my brother & mom went back the next day after I left for home.

We checked in and was told they wouldn't serve us there and that was a waiting area even though I showed them the post. Apparently this isn't communicated with the staff even though he claimed it would be fixed in the previous post...

753,Anna M.,"For such a tourist area, I was impressed with the food/prices here! Came here for a quick snack around 1:30pm on Sunday and was seated within 10 mins. Crazy busy at all times!

We were seated next to the window which was great, but it was freakin' HOT! If the sun's out and it's warm outside, ask for a seat away from the windows. There's no way to get away from the heat otherwise!

Ordered:
x Clam Chowder in Sourdough - I was craving clam chowder the second I woke up and this one did not disappoint! I LOVEEE sourdough bread so the bread bowl was just EVERYTHING! Tore apart the whole bowl and eat 90% of it. Not sure if it's true, but the clam chowder received an award from ""best clam chowder"" :P Only $11!
x Mussels & Fries - Flavor were great and the mussels were so fresh/perfectly cooked, but the mussels were SO big it was hard for me to eat. I get easily grossed out by huge shellfish so it just wasn't my cup of tea. If you don't mind that, you'd LOVE this dish. 

Fun area to go to once in awhile. Wouldn't mind coming back to try the shellfish platter :)

A-OKAY in my book!

I order the crab cocktail which was good. The star of the show for me was the entree. The mixed grill with a sampling of cod, salmon, and shrimp. The salmon was melt in your mouth good as was the cod. The shrimp was sweet and delicious. 

The sourdough is tasty too. Not sure what the hype is with sourdough on the pier but it was a nice addition to the meal for sure.

Most restaurants at Pier 39 or Fisherman's Wharf are not good quality and geared to be tourist traps.....but not Fog Harbor! 

They have a fantastic location on the upper level of Pier 39 with a great view overlooking the bay and boat harbor, you can even see the sea lions in the distance.

Service is amazing from start to finish, the staff is always very attentive and pleasant....we have even spoken with Mario, the manager and he is extremely pleasant and is very intent on making sure you enjoy your meal and experience.

the menu consists of all the San Francisco favorites and they are very tasty!  Everything from the clam chowder to the salads and sandwiches and pasta!

The menu stays the same regardless of lunch or dinner... although I was kinda in the mood for something ""brunchy"". But not to be discouraged.. I went with (well, the three of us) the clam chowder- when in Rome!! My sister and I both added the crab meat to our dishes as well. The chowder was everything we wanted and more. Full of seafood and not too heavy. Paired with their fantastic house-baked bread... I'm drooling as we speak. 

I would have liked slightly more options for a midday treat but overall, a great spot. And the place is huge!!

763,David B.,"I've had this certain problem since I was a youngster. I hate what everybody else is doing. Prefer to visit places off the beaten track. Of course, there are certain exceptions. Pier 39/Fisherman's Wharf is one of those exceptions, a place I have loved since I first visited in 1975/6. During a recent trip to San Francisco/Monterey, we visited Fog Harbor twice. Once at the beginning of the trip. Once at the end.

Our first visit came at the end of a long day of travel. We scored the last booth in the place, ordered a crisp white or four and a mess of sppetizers. Calamari, a spicy shrimp app. Everything was outstanding and delivered with a smile. We really enjoyed ourselves and the trip got off to a very nice start.

Our second visit was on the fourth of July. Pandemonium was the name of the game. Out on the Wharf and inside the restaurant. We waited forty five minutes due to an odd snafu with Open Table that isn't worth getting into. Our table was very nice with an outstanding view of the water and passing squadrons of Brown Pelican. We ordered more nice white wine, apps, crab salad and fried shrimp. Again, everything was delicious.

Midway through our meal, a family with two small children were seated next to us. While one parent played on his phone, and the other strolled around the restaurant looking to charge up her phone, the two kids screamed, blocked passers by, nearly tripped servers. One kid ran around clutching a butter knife. The little pisher then wacked my wife in the back of the head. In a perfect world, these people and their obnoxious children would have been hustled to the door and told never to return. But I'm quite sure the Cornell School for Hospitality frowns on that.

A hard working manager tried to stop the insanity. I did also but alas, these folks spoke no English so the man with the purple face(me) had little to no effect. What a nice guy, that manger. Wish we could have chatted more with him in a calmer environment. A true gem.

Fog Harbor provides good eats in the midst of a bustling tourist area. We like it very much.

This place came up on Yelp with great reviews so we went. It did NOT disappoint. The service was GREAT, the location (Embarcadero) was very nice, and the views from the restaurant are amazing. It's literally the perfect spot for just about anything. My only hesitation about a 5-star review is the menu...it's a little limited. Other than that, I highly recommend this place. Now, about this Risotto....it's not an easy dish to prepare, and it can either be incredible or awful. Mine was INCREDIBLE! I was able to customize mine to my liking, and it was perfect. The flavor was spot on, and the portion was HUGE. I will definitely return to this location when I'm the area again.

I ordered the Seafood Penne and my mother ordered a crab sandwich and both meals were delicious.

In fact it was my first time ever trying mussels, and this restaurant has me hooked... Unfortunately I haven't experienced any other restaurant that matches the yumminess of this one though!  

There is plenty of seating and did not have to witness any wait.  The waiter was very nice and quick to serve us.

The view and ambiance was also really quite wonderful.  
Parking could be a problem for some people, yet if you are familiar with San Francisco you should know public transportation or walking is really the most viable way to get around.

It's one of the best I've ever had, if not the best (beating Boudin by a mile). The clam chowder here has a good creamy base that's not too salty with a really nice balance of spices and generous portions of clam. They don't skimp on the seafood at all. A bowl is $9 and comes with fresh warm sourdough bread.

Skip the chicken penne - bland and over cooked chicken, watery sauce. Also skip the beef skewers, weird glaze with a sour taste and too salty.
Customer service did not stand out. Luckily their seafood was spectacular and we had great seats by the windows, but they barely made the 4 star cut for me.

A solid five star for the nice view (especially when you arrived in the evening and sit beside the sea), delicious meals and the nice service. 

Shellfish plates- you'll get clams, crabs, shrimps and potatoes. All are fresh and well cooked. We didn't want to have potatoes for dinner so we asked for a replacement with veggies and we got bunch of amazing beans! Thank you, the nice server. 

Scallop crabs risotto (spring special)definitely worths the price. We were hesitate at first for the high price that can order 2nd shellfish plates-. But then the decision was right-- this risotto was amazing! So tasty. It would be more wonderful if the size can be larger. 

The only thing I can complain about is the waiting list-- too long!! But they msg when you're the next on the list, so you don't need to wait there.

787,Angela D.,"My sister, myself and my nephew were visiting Pier 39 on our first day in San Francisco.  It was on a Wednesday somewhere around 3pm.  We decided to come to Pier39 for lunch because it had some good reviews on Yelp and you could see the water from the restaurant. As soon as we walked into the restaurant we were greeted and seated in the back of the restaurant with views of the water.  It was great that they automatically filled up all of the tables near the water first rather than having to ask like at some restaurants.  

Our waiter finished up with another table then a few minutes later, greeted us and took our drink order.  He brought our drinks then came back to take our lunch order.  I ordered the clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl, my nephew got a cup of soup and my sister got a salad.  A few minutes later the waiter brought us some bread and butter which was very good! You could easily tell it was made fresh.

The waiter noticed my water was gone and said he would bring some more.  A little bit later our meal came and it looked great.  Our waiter welcomed some other tables, brought them some water and I think then remembered about my water so he came back about 10 minutes later with some water.  I was so thirsty.
  
The meal was very good and the prices weren't bad especially since we were in such a high tourist part of town.  Our waiter seemed like he took a while to bring the check but did get it and offered to validate parking but we already had it validated from somewhere else. 
Overall lunch was nice.  There were great views of the seals, Alcatraz and my nephew seemed happy to look out the window.

792,Mike N.,"The restaurant has great ambience while still in the prime location of Pier 39. However today I was deeply disappointed with their service. We had a few things to try and it was all pretty good. We had the award winning clam chowder, Dungeness crab cakes, raw oysters, jumbo scallop and crab risotto, and the ahi tuna. The clam chowder was definitely great, it was not too heavy but just enough, it had a great portion of bacon and all the good stuff. The crab cakes were good as well. I liked the scallop and crab risotto as well. But the service here, was just terrible. Our drinks were never refilled or asked if we wanted another drink. We had to ask for everything, straws, etc . Our table was never cleared at anytime either. All of our plates were just sitting on the table. I was stacking plates one on top of another to open up space. Even after we moved on from the apps to the dinner items everything was left behind, app plates, the empty app plates, the oysters, everything. The oyster dish was sitting on our table even when we left which we finished fairly quickly after they were dropped off at our table. The ice turned into water and the oyster shells were floating around in the dish. 

After paying $170+ dollars is this what I should expect? By all means I have no issue spending money on food. But it really just hits a nerve when I get crappy service and I'm paying for it.....

I would go else where if your thinking about The Fog Harbor Fish House.

The restaurant looks super fantastic. Very high class restaurant except you don't have to be all dressed for it. 

There was only 3 dishes I wanted to try. That was the baked oysters, the famous clam chowder in a bread bowl, and whole dungeness crab. 

The baked oysters was such an awesome starter. That oyster was so freshly cooked and flavor was absolutely stunningly delicious. I wish I had 3 dozens of those. 

The famous clam chowder in a bread bowl. Probably the best clam chowder I have ever had. The consistency, the flavor, and the chuck of clams were great. The sour dough bread really compliments well with the clam chowder. 

The whole dungeness crab, I was looking really forward too. When our server came out with the crab I was shocked it was split into 2 plates. I had assume it was presented as a whole crab, but instead our server requested the kitchen staff to split into 2 plates without asking me. The presentation lost its ""WOW"" factor and I was super disappointed in that. 

Otherwise the crab was very good. Great garlic flavor. Good chunks of crab meat. 

Should really give this place a shot. Great seafood dishes. Except if you get a whole crab, make sure they serve it whole and not split between two plates.

And the setting was beautiful, the waitstaff was beyond sweet and attentive, but I am surprised at all the great reviews. 

The best thing we ordered was the crab cocktail. Like shrimp cocktail, but with extremely fresh lump crab meat. It's straightforward but the seafood is quality, it's worth getting.

The chowder in a sourdough bread bowl was really bland. We seasoning it ourselves at the table but it still didn't hit the mark. I got the Cioppino, crab, fish, shrimp, clams, scallops and mussels in tomato broth.The broth was also under seasoned, for the most part the seafood was good though (especially the crab, seems to be a strong choice here), just not a dish that was worth $34. The fried combo (shrimp, calamari, fish with cole slaw and fries) was totally over fried.

My son and I were in the mood for comfort food. While my son ordered the fish and chips, I ordered the fried shrimp and fries. My husband ordered the swordfish. We also ordered the calamari appetizer. 

The calamari came out fairly quickly and was delicious. My son and I both thought our meals were wonderfully tasty. I thought the coleslaw and fries were yummy too. My husband, who went the healthier route, said his swordfish was fresh and delicious as well. 

Service was good here. Our drinks were refilled quickly. Our server checked on us often. The staff seemed friendly and helpful. Even though though the restaurant was extremely busy, everyone was really nice here.

Had the pleasure to come here for lunch-early dinner a couple of summers ago and I've been dying to come back to this city and this restaurant since then.

We shared appetizers first, sliders, crab cake and crispy calamari. They all were on point!!

I ordered Seafood Penne accompanied with a cup of their award winning clam chowder. I have to repeat myself, i've been wishing i could come back. 

Everything was perfect, from the food to the service. I said it was one of the finest restaurants i've been to because the way they take care of the customers' need is something else. Waiters and waitresses are on another level. 
At some point my phone died, since I was on vacation I was carrying my charger everywhere, I asked one of the waitresses to take my phone somewhere safe so it could charge a little and she brought me a portable charger so I wouldn't have to worry about it, she made my day. Of course, that's one of the things this restaurant has to offer to the clients but to me it was a kindness act and great way to take care of the clients' needs.

If you happen to be in San Francisco, don't leave without paying a visit to this place. Almost forgot to mention, if you happen to be lucky like we were, you'll be seated near the huge windows that offer a view to the bay, in the evening it's BEAUTIFUL here. Come by and rate

I haven't met a piece of bread I didn't enjoy, but these were crunchy, doughy and perfect. Dinner I had the shrimp cocktail and a Caesar salad with fresh crab meat. Everyone at the table loved their food too. Please eat here!!!!! Your unbuttoned pants afterwards will thank you.

804,Nhi D.,"When my friends said they wanted to have dinner at Pier 39, I immediately had to go on Yelp to find a good restaurant in this tourist trap. Fog Harbor Fish House didn't disappoint me. We came here at 6pm and luckily we were seated right away. 

Well, this place had excellent view overlooking the harbor. We were able to eat and watch the sunset at the same time. It was a memorable experience. The service was also excellent. The waiter was extremely attentive and accomodating to us. We decided to order everything together and share between us. We got 4 cups of clam chowder, 1 baked oyster, 1 mixed grill, 1 cioppino and 1 linguin clam. These were enough to fill us up cuz the portions were pretty generous. In short, I liked everything we ordered but I think everything was over-seasoned here. Most dishes were salty and I had to drink lots of water to finish the meal. Nevertheless, the seafood was fresh and tasty. I's give 5 stars to Fog Harbor if its food wasn't too salty. I hope they would mofiy their recipe to make it less salty.

805,Cyn T.,"I always enjoy Fog Harbor! They served hot crusty bread and butter. Not a lot of places serve got bread anymore or perhaps I'm not going to the right restaurants. Lol

Their service was topnotch! There was tons of fast moving servers and lots of clientele ready to be served. The place was bustling with activity though we felt very taken care of.
Their clam chowder is the bomb diggity! It is thick, rich, full of clams and potatoes. Not too creamy. Just how I like it.
We ordered the fish and chips and this was my only area of concern. The fish was tasteless. No flavor at all! Very disappointing.
Since we were running to catch the ferry we didn't have time to have the order remade.
I'll still go back again and enjoy that crusty bread and clam chowder. 
Yum!

Our waiter was funny and did a great job tonight. We had fried calamari for an appetizer I got the grilled shrimp brochette and my wife got the seafood platter. The calamari was fried perfectly and tasted great. My grilled shrimp was exactly how I wanted it. The potatoes had a good flavor but were a little chunky. The lobster from the seafood platter was really good with the butter sauce on the bottom of the plate. The clams and mussel weren't really seasoned but dipping them in the sauce was good enough. The crab was good and a little messy but that was okay.

I would definitely recommend this place. The food was great and the service was excellent!

815,Grace H.,"This was my first time visiting, but my friend who has visited many times before always raved about the service. She booked a reservation for my birthday weekend and I was delighted to have my birthday dinner here. 

Justin was the SWEETEST server ever!!! Absolutely loved him and all of his recommendations! He was very thoughtful and always checked up on us. Because it was my birthday, he brought out the dessert tray and let me choose one! He also rallied up his coworkers to sing to me, which I really appreciated as I noticed some other tables didn't get the same service. I'm so happy Fog Harbor hired such a sweet gentleman like Justin. Service was seriously impeccable!!!! I will always request Justin whenever I visit now. 

The food we ordered: 
Crispy Calamari-super light batter and fried to perfection
Shellfish Platter-great variety, they did not skimp out 
Garlic Roasted Dungeness Crab-I loved the sauce base and potatoes were just a bonus hehe 

I think this was more than enough food for two small girls, we were definitely struggling to finish everything, BUT SO WORTH IT JUST DO IT DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

The other 3 were lost due to the attitude of the hostesses and the poor quality of the food. We ordered the crab chicken cocktail and the lobster tails.

819,Kaley K.,"Fog Harbor Fish House is the perfect spot to grab lunch or dinner in the heart of all of Pier 39.

The place is popular so expect wait times but don't let that stop you from having some of the best clam chowder in the bay area!

Our large group didn't have to wait too long for a table, which was great (because we were hungry) Our table had a view of the water - as most of them do- which was fun!

We started with the cheese bread and calamari but if you're not feeling apps the complimentary bread will be excellent too! The cheese bread was very creamy on top, crisp on the bottom. The calamari had jalapenos fried with it, which was incredibly refreshing and tasty! 

The clam chowder in a bread bowl was perfect for a late lunch! I wish I would have had room for the whole bread bowl!

I highly recommend coming to Fog Harbor Fish house for a good meal and a good drink. It's a perfect place for a date or for a larger group.

821,Diana M.,"I was surprised that I enjoyed this restaurant! I rarely visit Fisherman's wharf or Pier 39. I always thought good here is mediocre. I happened to come here during one of my "" let's-be-tourist-for-the-day"" days. I had just come off from a visit to Alcatraz and was hungry after a morning full of sightseeing. It was Wednesday and the closest seafood restaurant with no lines was Fog Harbor. I was seated right away and was pleased that they didn't put me at the bar (seeing as I was by myself). 

The view was fantastic but I was there for the food. Seafood. They did pretty well. Mind you, I went to Swan Oyster Depot the previous day, which has mind blowing, freshest seafood you could ever find in SF. I didn't have high hopes for FH. I was just hungry, really. 

I ordered their shrimp cocktail which were quite good. They were large shrimps, simple and straight to the point. No BS there. Then their oysters were the right amount of sweet and briny which I loved. The main course which was seared cod with a side of white beans, roasted tomatoes and spinach was delicious. A tad salty but it did the job for me. They had a great selection of cocktails as well. I opted for fresh pisco sour which I thought was perfect for the sweet and salty flavors I was getting from both oysters and cod. The service was great too. My server was attentive and everyone there seem happy to answer any questions. Given that it was also Fleet week, I thought the place wasn't so crazy that day. It was Wednesday around noon, yet everyone was seated pretty quickly. I'm glad I decided to come here even on a whim!

My boyfriend and I went here on a nice Saturday. Our first trip to SF for 2018! Wait time was only 15-20 mins which wasn't bad. We got seated and our server Lidia did great. She made sure to ask about food allergies! I'm happy that she asked because I am allergic to shrimp. My boyfriend and I got the shellfish platter for 2. Prior to the arrival of the food, Lidia put our bibs on and even fixed my hair after putting it on. That bit of care for her customer got her a good tip from my boyfriend and I. It meant she actually cared. 

On top of the great customer service, the food is always excellent.

I must say I agree. The chowder was yummy to my tummy. It was rich and creamy. The flavor was perfect and I ate every last drop. I left happy and content. I would definitely go back and try some of there other food. One of the best clam chowders I've ever had.

824,Junella T.,"This place is good in only a tourist trap kinda way can be. Don't get me wrong,  I enjoyed the food and the atmosphere, but come'on. For the price of our entrees, we should be getting way better everything.

Our waiter couldn't be bothered to remember our order. We were a party of 4 and whenever drinks or food came out. He would just randomly put stuff down and not remember who ordered what. Also when my shellfish platter came out, it was pretty hot and he just hands me the plate and doesn't say anything.

I ordered a cup of clam chowder and the shell fish platter for one. The platter is 1/2 of a crab, mussels, clams, shrimp and fingerling potatoes.  The seafood was good but very messy. They give you a bib to wear but that only help with the splatter and not your hands. Don't get me wrong I love to eat seafood with my hands but this platter was cooked with a TON of garlic and butter so the entire plate was drowning in it. It overwhelms the taste of the seafood.   

I would consider coming back but with SF being a foodie city. There are many better places out there for seafood.

827,Nick A.,"Found this place almost by accident after kicking around Pier 39 and this ended up being one of our best meals in San Francisco.  As much as Boudin Bakery is lauded for having the best sourdough bread bowls of clam chowder in town, the consensus amongst my group is that Fog Harbor wins hands down!  The chowder was rich and flavorful, the clams fresh and not rubbery, and the bread -- LORD -- the bread.

Once we came down from the high of the soup, I moved on to some of the best Fish & Chips that I have ever had, before or since.  The fish was fresh and flaky, the breading was thick but not greasy, and the tarter sauce was light and citrousy -- a great balance to the fish.

The culinary adventure continued on to dessert where we went with the Chocolate Banana Bread Pudding (fresh Boudin's sourdough bread, baked with banana and chocolate, topped with vanilla bean sauce) and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!  Not overpoweringly banana and balanced well with the chocolate and vanilla bean sauce.  This meal was incredible beginning to end!
 
From the awesome location, to the awesome 3-course meal, and impeccable service, Fog Harbor delivers on its well-deserved reputation.

Breaking the yummy part down:

Clam chowder in sour dough bowl- thick, flavorful and delicious!

Salmon with pumpkin curry - Salmon is flavorful,  pan seared to a perfect light crispy texture over a sweet pumpkin sauce (the curry taste is not very strong).

Luguini clam pasta- I'm not a fan of clams but loved he overall dish. If you're a garlic fan like me then you will appreciate garlic sauce flavor

Didn't know this place is located in Pier 39 until we got there.  **Note** This place only validate parking in the garage for an hour and it will take you more than an hour to eat at this place.

We waited about 15 mins before we got seated.  Order half a dozen of fresh oysters, a cup of the award winning clam chowder, crab roll, and Seafood Penne.  The oysters were very fresh and delicious.  The clam chowder was delicious.  It had a lot of clams and the thickness of the soup was perfect. The crab roll was also delicious and it came with a side of fries..yummy.  The roll just meats in your mouth and they they were generous with the crab and it was also very fresh.  The beau had the seafood penne and it was also pretty good.

Given the review and crowds, I was looking forward to a tasty dinner.  

I started with their award winning clam chowder.  The temperature of my chowder was tepid, otherwise the soup was creamy and full of clams.  

My dinner choice was the crab roll. I really wanted to try their crab but was lazy and didn't want to get messy (work dinner).   I think a little celery salt and a lot less mayo would have helped.  The fries were hot, crispy and nicely salted. 

The complementary hot sourdough roll was the best thing I ate.

The pasta was absolutely delicious! Full of clams, in a very garlicky wine sauce. PRO TIP: don't fill up on the noodles- instead use the bomb sourdough bread to soak up the sauce.

Yes, we are south Asian but we have lived in the states for a long time and we have a lot of money to spend. The server was making cheap racists comments about how we needed a picture book of menu to select from?! Do you think we are uneducated? We have masters from ivy leagues so please don't jump into conclusions. Next, he had a huge problem with us sharing the food. Since it was 3pm already, we weren't too hungry so we ordered 4 dishes in total and shared. Is that a sin? He was continuously making comments to his fellow waiters serving us about how we are sharing our food. To end it, he was very interested to see how much we tipped him?! Don't make it too obvious and treat your customers like dirt. If you are in a service industry, please treat your customers with respect. Never going back or recommending to any friends or even foes. To the server, you know who you are!! Stop being racist and get a life!

We had just disembarked from our trip to Alcatraz. After a 5 hour stay on The Rock, we were hungry and decided to grab a bite since we were in the Fisherman's Wharf area. I fired up the Yelp app and searched for some seafood restaurant recommendations. 
We entered Fog Harbor and immediately noticed the beautiful view. The sun was setting so just imagine an amazing cotton candy sky. We waited approximately 5 minutes for our table even though it was dinner time. Walking through the dining room the plates looked promising.
We ordered the bread bowl of chowder topped with crab, calamari, fish & chips, and sourdough bread.
The food was just fine. The calamari was good. Fresh squid and tartar sauce that tasted from a bottle but I could be incorrect. The fish & chips were tasty. Big portion of fish with bagged frozen fries. The bread bowl of clam chowder was also ok. I wish it would've had not crab. The bread bowl wasn't cut that deep but the upper 2/3 of the bread bowl was filled with chowder.
The service was good. Our 1st waitress was nice. She continuously brought us bread and filled our water glasses without giving us a second look. Unfortunately she had to leave mid-service. Our 2nd server was just as nice. 
What really left a bad impression on us was that a f-ing MOUSE ran into the dining area.  YES A F-ING MOUSE!!! The thing scurried in and was less than 3' from us. It may have been hurt because it was in the middle of the floor until one of the busboys grabbed it with a napkin.

They ran out of oyster forks so I was trying to slurp the oysters with a butter knife. It's a tourist spot, so I'd just avoid if you can....


Update based on the restaurant's response:  We visited on August 16th around dinner time. We sat in the near the window, straight off the path the leads to the restrooms.

860,Courtney W.,"After a long day of traveling back in to San Fran, we decided to stop along Pier 39 and have a late lunch. It was definitely not as casual on the inside as we had been expecting, and were promptly seated inside (sadly not along the exterior for the amazing harbor view). The service was a tad on the slow side but we weren't in much of a hurry. 

I went with the soup and salad combo ($16) that is served in a classic bread bowl. The soup (their famous chowder) was indeed amazing and everything I had hoped for. I definitely was not hungry after eating that. 

They also provide the table with a complimentary bread basked which was very delicious. And we ordered an appetizer of calamari because of course - and it was perfectly seasoned and cooked. 

For the quality and the price it's a great spot - I thought very reasonable for a touristy area. The dessert tray is massive and very tempting!

865,Marika D.,"I originally chose this place because of the beautiful view. And that did not disappoint at all. But, if you have the option, come during daytime! The harbor is a bit dark at night.

Our server was very sweet and helpful with suggestions.
My friend and I decided to share a few dishes. We started with the calamari. Tasty and not overly fried, though I can't say I would order it again. 

For our entree we had the cioppino. Our server kindly had the plate split without us even asking.
I'd been wanting to have cioppino in San Francisco for the longest time, because I found out that is where it's originated from (I found this out while looking for it everywhere in Italy LOL). They were anything but stingy with the portion of seafood - though I wouldn't have minded a little more crab hehe. And as this is a fish house on the harbor, the seafood was all super fresh! But unfortunately, I've had better cioppino elsewhere. Maybe it was something off about the broth, but I remember not feeling completely satisfied. Maybe my expectations were just too high.

But my slightest bit of disappointment with my less than perfect cioppino was ceased when the dessert menu was brought out! They all looked so good that my friend and I had trouble deciding... but luckily there was a dessert with two mini portions! This worked out perfectly as my friend wanted the creme brulee and I wanted the dark chocolate mousse.
The creme brulee was delicious! Sweet and perfectly glazed on top.
The chocolate mousse... sent me to heaven. Perfect blend of bitter and sweet. Literally just melted in my mouth.

Perfect way to start our SF trip!

The Oysters were really small compared to what we've had in the past, at other seafood hubs, but still good if you're really craving them. Also, make sure to get on the waitlist on the Yelp app to avoid the long wait times. The wait can be about two hours during dinner time so make sure to get on the waitlist before you're hungry. My husband and I got on the waitlist and walked Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39 while we waited for our turn. It was really helpful that you could see your place in line on the yelp app and they send you text notifications to let you know when to check in. All in all, great place to eat with a great view of the bay. Perfect for special occasions.

875,Ben J.,"Forget about this place, at least that's what i told my wife, but not in such pleasant terms. Upon arrival at 4:45pm on 4/21/19, we were promised a table for 2 in 15-20 min. I followed up politely after 45 minutes of waiting at the bar, and the hostess said it's still another 20-30 minutes, and wasn't apologetic or willing to offer anything to make up for the delay, at all. Yet there was nobody waiting for a table when we decided to leave 10 minutes later. 

Not sure if it had anything to do with my skin tone, but it wasn't the most diverse crowd.  And we didn't have time to sit and wonder about their incompetence, especially after we waited so long and they didn't even have the decency to follow up proactively.  The bartender was kind enough to offer us a place to eat at the bar, but i declined as we would have ordered food at the bar 1 hour ago if that's what we wanted. 

Took a quick stroll to Pier Market, and enjoyed impeccable service, absolutely delicious food, all without any delay in a full house.

I was craving for a whole crab along with a side of pasta & veggies.  Their award winning clam chowder also lives up to its reputation.  I left there VERY satisfied.  We'll be back soon on our next visit.

878,Christopher B.,"I came here as a tourist with my family and had a great time! The ambiance is a bit top notch in comparison to some other spots on pier 39 and the view to Alcatraz and the golden gate work look amazing on sunset dinner. The seafood is fresh like the clam chowder which has an award, the only thing I would recommend is to get a bowl and skip the bread bowl as it gets soggy. The fish and chips and great and huge! They even split the dish for you and it seems like too much to order for two people, so I recommend it as an appetizer with some other combo they have. The pasta was all right but the seafood in it was good, I don't think I'd buy It again. In conclusion maybe go for a martini and some light dinner as you enjoy the amazing view it has of the bay!

There was a plethora of fish and shellfish swimming in what I would consider more of a sauce than a broth with some nice sourdough on the side.  Was it a good representation of the dish?  I'm not sure but it was damn good.  

Keep it up lads, looking forward to coming back.

882,Adrian A.,"After a second visit today, Fog Harbor Fish House is now firmly on my list of seafood restaurants to go to when in SF. Its location on Pier 39 might initially be a turn-off if you are really just trying to scratch a seafood itch and don't relish the idea of wading through all the tourists milling around the shops. However, the food is worth it. Luckily enough, the restaurant is located on the second floor of one of the buildings closest to curbside, so not much wading is involved. 

I would describe the interior of the restaurant as ""modern"". The seating options are a mix of booths and standard tables, as well as space at the bar, which I think was for walk-ins. Large windows facing the moorings for the Blue & Gold tour boats lets lots of light in during the day and makes for a nice view from the window tables.

The menu is definitely geared towards seafood aficionados, though there are some non-seafood choices. As I understand it, Fog Harbor is part of the Simmons Family Restaurants group, which has several types of seafood restaurants in and around Pier 39. One thing to bear in mind is that this is the more ""proper"" of the group's restaurants, and is pricier as a result. 

You will be hard pressed to find better seafood for the price though. On both of our visits here, we ordered the cioppino (seafood stew), the clam chowder, and the bay scallops. The seafood is all fresh, tasty, and generously portioned. The main courses I ordered were the lobster tails on our first visit, and the scallop and crab risotto the second visit. Both dishes were phenomenal.

One thing worth mentioning is that the servers we got both times were very attentive and friendly. Our second visit was actually for a birthday lunch, which I made a note of on my reservation, and our server (Kayla) gave us a dessert on the house, complete with a candle in it! It was the tiramisu, which is definitely worth saving space for. 

In short, I am already looking forward to my next visit to Fog Harbor!

I am glad we did- although it was crowded- it was suggested that we sit at the bar because we were told it is a 'full service bar'.  

The bartenders were friendly and made drink recommendations which we were glad we agreed.  We both had a flovered type of martini and it was delicious!  It was so good that we both quickly ordered another round.  

My friend ordered the crab roll & I went with the red chili shrimp & calamari.  All of the food was FRESH, seasoned and prepared perfectly.  The portions were sizeable & we both couldn't finish our meals.

During our time at the restaurant, all of the staff were super friendly and attentive.

We were in on Tuesday 11/20.  We had the red chili shrimp which were over cooked, not many of them but taste was great.  Crab cakes did not have a lot of flavor.  Crab ceviche special again did not have much flavor, but had a nice presentation. Caesar salad was nice and fresh. Shellfish platter crab was tasty, mussels and shrimp were over cooked with most left on the plate.  Bob, judging food quality is always tied with the price you pay....if you don't spend much you can't really complain about the quality....but the lunch seafood dishes ranged in price from $16 to $70....at these prices the food should be spectacular.  By the way, the chowder was great!

It came out room temperature. The noodles are okay. They didn't taste like fresh noddles to me. The sauce was pretty bland, not that much flavor. Now, the clams.... there were like 5 clams in shells that were not big, but bigger than the tiny ones. There were like 30 tiny, tiny clams... they were soggy and fishy!!! It felt like they came straight out of a can! I have no idea if they're fresh or not but that's what I think about it. Overall, I do not recommend!!

The servings are quite small. However, for a restaurant this popular and well sought after the staff was not very welcoming. I work in the food industry myself and I try to put up my best attitude and best smile while I'm at work all the time and I got to say I was not impressed. My mother went up to the head server/waiter outside the restaurant to ask how long the wait was and in return he scowled at her and told her to wait in line....I'm sorry but he did not need to scowl! My mom went up to ask a simple question so we wouldn't have to end up waiting in line for two hours. After this incident, we had to wait forty minutes for a table even though a couple parties who reserved their spots after us were let in first. After we were seated, our waitress didn't have the best attitude as well. Essentially, she seemed fed up. Overall, the food was great and if you're still hungry after you finish your meal they have unlimited rolls but for a place as popular as this place I expected better service.

897,Natasha R.,"While the hubs and I are on our way to our go-to spot to get our crab craving fix, on a whim we decided to try some place new, and boy i do not regret that decision one bit!

We agreed on Fog Harbor Fish House based on their Yelp reviews (thank you, fellow Yelpians).

We started with the calamari. Mouth.Watering. it's the jalapenos, i swear! And to top it off with the lemon aioli. I died, inside. Happily.

The shellfish platter is a must! The hubs is a big guy, so the platter for two plus the lobster was filling for him. I feel as though if he were to have bought it for 1, he'd be asking for a snickers bar (drumroll, with a hit of the symbols - bam). Shellfish platter for two came with 1 whole crab, 12 clams, 12 shrimp and 12 mussels. We added a lobster for an additional cost.

 The seafood penne was satisfying. Not as much flavor as I wished for, but I guess it's expected when you have a variety of seafood in a pasta - I'm assuming they were trying to put an emphasis in the seafood, rather than seasoning it up and hiding the seafood's natural flavor. And I am not mad at that.

And to end our beautiful experience (almost cried because desserts are always a reminder that you are almost done) I couldn't help, but salivate over their apple crisp. Lord, help me.

Just screw this review and go and get yourself a seat at this place.

Thanks Bob for reaching out-the restaurant business is a hard one and I do Appreciate you asking when we came in and what we had. My husband and I dined last night (Sunday night) we had a reservation at 7:45 but we arrived early and got a table at 6:30. While waiting for our table we sat at the bar and ordered drinks, when the drinks were served the hostess came and took us to our table. We ordered the crab cocktail which was good but could have been dressed up a little like the shrimp cocktail. I had a shrimp dish that was drenched in garlic butter, spinach (no taste) and something of a mashed potato that had diced potatoes that were not cooked thru. The bread was delicious. The waiter was rushing us into ordering and we told him we didn't want to be rushed as we were drinking our cocktails and having our appetizer. So that's it !

902,Teri A.,"This was my second visit. The first time (about 4 years ago) I loved it. This time, it was disappointing. First of all, I was traveling with a vegetarian. Mind you, we were aware this being a seafood joint, but our plan was to order her a pasta dish and omit the meat. Usually this is just fine. So she ordered the chicken and vegetable penne without chicken. What she got was watery pasta, with mostly raw green beans, red onions, zucchini. No sauce, no cheese, absolutely no flavor. What self respecting cook didn't even think to caramelize those veggies for some flavor, add garlic, or serve it with some type of sauce. Sent that disaster back and they did take it off our bill. 

I had the cioppino- it was ok but the sauce tasted overwhelmingly like dry herbs- think prego pasta sauce. 

Third friend got the fish n chips. Fish was large chunks, not filets, and pretty greasy. 

Probably won't be back. There has got to be better seafood in SF.

903,Melissa T.,"Fog Harbor Fish House was probably the most recommended place (by yelp) and there were some high expectations because of that. In short, I'd say that the food lived up to the expectations in my head.

Here are some helpful tips:
-The waiting area is beautiful. True. 
-Make a reservation a week in advance if it's a Friday or weekend. Waiting is fine, but it gets cold and windy, so be prepared. 
-Ask for a water view. 

The service: 
The hostess people were very friendly, BUT I'd say it's hard to hear when they call your names, so stick close to the stand. Once you're inside, the waiters and waitresses are pretty attentive and make sure you always have fresh bread.

The atmosphere:
The restaurant is deceivingly large and the feel is very classy and very vibrant when you walk in. There are a mixture of people from different places, but they all are smiling and happy. 

The food:
Since this was my first time here, I can't talk about the food fully, BUT I'll say that what we had was great. We started with the calamari, which was fresh and lightly fried (perfection). The mixed grill and salmon plates were also impeccable and I'd definitely recommend. When I come back I'll have to try a dessert or two because they looked amazing when they'd walk by our table with them. 

Conclusion: 
Do I recommend it? Of course! It has the most reviews for a reason. The views of the bridge and the harbor are to die for and the food is the perfect pairing with a stunning landscape.

Went with cup of clam chowder and crab cakes for start and then garlic roasted crab.
Crab was delicious!! Nicely balanced on butter and minced garlic.
Chowder was exquisite too. 
The only thing we were not thrilled by were crab cakes. Afterall were ok, but not that flavorful and we like big chunks of crab meat in crab cakes which we missed here. So we'd give 4,5* for that but we really like that they're sustainable sorced with the fish they use so we give 5* in total.

916,Dawn N.,"My husband and I took a chance as a walk in at Fog Harbor Fish House After not being able to get a reservation.  We were happy to be seated after having a drink at the bar.  We had a table with a great view overlooking the bay.  Our waiter Mel was great!  He was personable, attentive and professional.  Our food was brought out in a timely fashion and everything was delicious.  We started with the clam chowder which was worth the hype and split the crab Louie salad which was tasty although the crabmeat on it was somewhat a skimpy portion in my opinion.  My husband had the Dungeness crab in garlic which he thoroughly enjoyed and I had the  Cioppino which was delicious as well. Mel surprised us with a crème brûlée dessert as we were celebrating our anniversary. And we topped it off with a  cappuccino.  We couldn't ask for better service or a more satisfying meal here during our San Fran visit.

919,Samantha D.,"Nice views, good food, but lacking in service. 

I went with on a Friday night at 5:00 pm with 3 guests for a birthday dinner. We went a little early in the evening to hopefully beat the dinner rush and we were sat immediately. There were three women standing at the hostess stand when we walked in, and not one smiled or greeted us. They acted as if we were inconveniencing them, but one sat us right away regardless. 

We got a booth with beautiful bay views. Our server came over fairly quickly and was friendly. 

Two of us ordered cocktails, and two ordered some of their specialty non-alcoholic beverages. We ordered our food fairly quickly as well. 

We hardly saw our server after that. One of our guests ordered the crab which was delivered (by someone other than our server) with no way to eat it. It took close to 10 minutes for us to be able to flag someone down to get the correct utensils. 

Our beverages remained empty from before our food was delivered until we left. Never once asked if we wanted another. Never asked if we had everything we needed. Our server never even stood at our table long enough to get a drink order in after taking our original order. I also sat with my water completely empty for at least 5 minutes, with no one in sight to fill it. 

The food was fairly good. I had the crab risotto and it was delicious and creamy, the scallops were cooked well. 

For the price of this meal, I was severely disappointed in the service we received. I understand that it can get pretty busy on a Friday night, but a restaurant should be well staffed enough to be able to get a drink refill.

920,Vivian D.,"For a tourist spot right on Pier 39- pretty decent! Got seated fairly quickly for a Sunday evening.  Also the bar looked really open and is first come first serve. Was craving fish and chips so we went here. Enjoy that the fish is beer-battered- makes it super crispy (but also very very greasy), plus the fish was supes fresh - tasted like real fish!. Fries were great too! The coleslaw is a bit tangy like reviews said- but it didn't bother me much. Plus the server was nice to tell us and said we could swap it out if we wanted. The clam chowder was good- a bit on the salty side- but a cup of it was just enough. Also tried the garlic butter roasted crab, which was great- pretty meaty. Super buttery and garlicky and it pools at the bottom. The bread rolls were great and warm- very sourdoughy but with the butter, it was yummy. Overall had a great time here. Service was really good! Would return!

921,Jacob R.,"We came here in a group of 4 on Sunday night and had to wait about 10 minutes for a table.

Food: The bread was soft and went well with my appetizer. I ordered the clam chowder topped with crab (off the appetizer menu) and it was absolutely fantastic. They put a hearty amount of crab on the delicious clam chowder.

For the main course, I ordered the Dungeness crab ravioli. Not being a huge ravioli guy (but wanting some sort of non-bread carb with my meal) I didn't expect to be as blown away as I was. The ravioli was cooked thoroughly and the ricotta inside was smooth. The pasta itself paired well with the spinach and the Dungeness crab. Every bite was seriously perfection.

Atmosphere: The restaurant is fancy and more upscale. The waiters are all professionally uniformed. Lots of tables looked like dates or nice dinner nights out. 

Parking: Given that this place is literally on the pier, parking will be a hassle to drive to this place. I would recommend Uber or walking here during your tourist explorations in SF. 

Service: The service really matched the mood. Our waiter was well-mannered and polite. He even brought us a second batch of bread.

This place is not cheap by any means. Don't let the two dollar signs fool you. I would say this place should have $$$ next to it. However, if you're looking for a fancy night out, or some quality seafood (expensive but worth), or somewhere to impress a date, this is your place.

The salmon was some of the best salmon I've had in a very long time. My husband particularly loved the fresh clam chowder.

931,Ed C.,"I went with two friends from out of town for a nice dinner at Fisherman's Wharf at around 7pm last night (Thurs) without a reservation. There were several parties ahead of us and we had to wait at the lounge for 30 minutes for our table, but the atmosphere was pleasant and we enjoyed the time. When our table is ready, a lady server led us to the table. It was a booth facing the sea view. It was good but since I saw there was a table open next to the window, I asked her if it is OK for us to have that table of six instead. She quickly checked with the manager and gladly gave us the table! The view was gorgeous.

Curtiss was our server and he was courteous and very detailed to share with us the menu items and open to us about his recommendation without imposing on us. We had a whole garlic crab, a pescatore pasta, and the famous clam chowder on review. The crab was not big but the taste is good and cooked just right. The pescatore is super delicious with scallops, prawns, mussels and clams. Although it is a little pricey. The clam chowder was very good. The taste is right, not too salty like most restaurants would have it, right amount of clams and potatoes, not to thick or thin. We all feel we want more of the chowder at the end. We had a very enjoyable evening. We like the place, the atmosphere, the view, the people, the service and the food. This is a place I would enjoy coming with friends regularly.

938,Samantha V.,"Just a FYI: I absolutely love clam chowder and am hard to impress when it comes to this amazing creamy, clam, potato, hint of bacon flavored savory chowder. 

Since I have gone to a few ""famous for their chowder"" restaurants in San Fran and was not pleased, I asked our server if I could try a small tasting of their clam chowder. Let me tell you, this taste test was my dinner deciding factor and the chowder blew me away. So creamy and filled with chunks of potato and clams in every bite. I did get it in the sour dough bread bowl and I must say, the next time I dine in, I will just order the bowl instead of bread bowl. I did however stop by the next day to pick up a cup and bowl sized chowder to go to bring back on my ride back home to LA. 

For appetizer we ordered the CALAMARI with the lemon aioli. The calamari was good, however I'm not sure if I am a huge fan of the dipping sauce as it was a little too salty for my palette. 

Boyfriend ordered FISH AND CHIPS. Not ever a fan of fish and chips since childhood however, this was AMAZING!!!! Flaky inside and perfectly battered and fried outside.  Also, the coleslaw that came with it had a slight kick, just FYI.

940,Sophia L.,"I've been here a few times I will say my best dining experience was my first visit . Chili shrimp flavorful and the sauce that comes with it was delicious. Calamari cooked just right not overly fried . Bread that came was a little hard . Clam chowder delicious as usual ! Ate the whole cup . My partner ordered the mix seafood plate and it was good. Salmon, cod, and shrimp . Drinks were made almost correctly wrong glass but still contained correct ingredients.. glass didn't stop us from ordering two rounds . I ordered the pan seared chicken the sauce that comes with it had a strong flavor which accompanied the chicken well. But may have been a little too salty for some. Reason for point deduction- Both plates came with mashed potatoes which were not good at all We both left them on the plate . No real flavor to them and they had a weird texture . Also kids were seated at the bar which bothered me a bit . Idk why it was allowed because I did see a bartender tell her she couldn't sit with her cards but she explained and they continued to sit with three young kids . Beyond me . I would recommend to anyone looking for a awesome seafood experience.

945,Sarah R.,"This restaurant is THE eatery to visit when you're at Pier 39 in San Francisco! Although the 40 minutes wait was quite long, it was totally worth it. The food, service and view were superb.

We were seated by the window, which we like, and could see the pier and ocean. We ordered the special -- which was a combination of lobster tail and steak -- plus the linguini & clams pasta, a dozen fresh oysters, and clam chowder. To go along with all the seafood, white wine was a must. The oysters were fair in proportion, yet not large enough to ""wow"" you. The clam chowder was delicious in particular. It had enough ingredients for the three of us. My personal favorites would be the clam chowder and lobster tail + steak special. The steak was cooked medium rare, and it was quite a unique experience switching off tender, moist beef with tougher, lobster meat... We devoured it. The linguini & clams pasta was decent, but not the best.

Our server was kind and very attentive. He was clearly busy running around, yet addressed our needs and always wore a smile. The restaurant was packed, without a single empty table. I'm unsure whether they take reservations or not, but this is a worthwhile place to check out.

Last but not least: don't forget to validate your parking when leaving!

949,Jenny N.,"Amazing dinner place for date nights - classy yet casual. Located on Pier 39, which has a lot of shops to check out while waiting for your name to be called for dinner. Wait for dinner wasn't long at all - maybe 15 minutes in total without a reservation on a Saturday night at 8pm.

We started off with the Mussel Fries ($16), which I HIGHLY recommend just because I'm a fry person. But also because it's actually delicious with the sauce and mussels. My boyfriend and I also split a clam chowder bread bowl ($11), but I recommend getting a regular bowl and using the complimentary sourdough bread to dip since you don't want to get full off of bread. For the main course, we ordered the lazy cioppino ($41), and our server split the dish between my boyfriend and I without us asking. It's too much if you eat alone. We also ended up sharing a dessert plate with chocolate cake and creme brûlée, very light & delicious even when you're full. 

Parking isn't bad... there's a parking garage that's located right across the street from pier 39 which is super convenient because we didn't want to waste time looking for street parking. Again, it's not a bad price...IF YOU DON'T LOSE YOUR PARKING TICKET. I cannot stress this enough. The parking ticket is your GOLDEN TICKET. Each hour is $10, with a max at 5 hours. You can get your ticket validated and get the first hour free. Our ticket would've have cost $10 since we only stayed for 2 1/2 hours, and we wouldve gotten the ticket validated. HOWEVER, we lost it and had to pay the max fee ($50), WHICH IS OUTRAGEOUS (I was very sad). Other than this, Fog Harbor would have gotten a 5 star review but parking wasn't an amazing experience :(

Once we did, they were extremely friendly and accommodating. We both got margaritas, I got the hibiscus version which mentioned having egg whites in it, which I typically love. The drink itself was extremely sour, and I can't believe it had egg whites in it bc it typically cuts any sour flavor.  No one ever checked to see how the drinks were, so I finished it begrudgingly. Not the best $15 I've ever spent. The oysters were phenomenal as was the sourdough bread. If I would have been able to order a different drink, it would have been 5 stars.

This is at the infamous Fisherman's Wharf, which is why I haven't been -- I prefer local spots, not tourist spots. This is definitely one of the tourist spots, filled with tourists who are shivering from the cold of the SF bay.

They have a large bar you can hang out at before dinner, since they can be quite busy during peak season. I came here with some family who are in town and wanted to have some ""authentic San Francisco seafood"", and went along even though I'm not sure what that meant ;)

Turns out, the food is actually pretty decent. They serve a lot of stereotypical seafood dishes, like crab cakes, lobster, cioppino, shrimp linguini... I would say the seafood itself is decent quality but not top notch, but the portions are generous and definitely would please one's Asian family.

Waitstaff was nice, and the food arrived in good time. I'd say, however touristy it may be, if you are entertaining tourists it is a good place to go around here.

We got the chilli shrimp, it was so delicious !! They topped it off with two garlic bread, but we devoured that so quickly because the sauce was perfection. We would have used the bread they gave us in the beginning to dip it in the sauce. (I'm sure they would he gave us more if we asked)

Then I ordered the shellfish platter for one, cooked cajun style because I special requested it that way. I wouldn't have it any other way, it was finger licking good.

The clam chowder bowl with crabs was slightly bland for my tasting. I didn't care too much about it.

974,Brittani K.,"I was told there was an hour wait so we decided to sit at the bar which had no wait. Unfortunately, the bartender/server was not very welcoming, and he came off as if he didn't want to serve us. We also felt he rushed our entire meal. The food looked really good but I honestly thought it was going to taste better...it was average. Save your money and go somewhere that appreciates their customers. 

Customer service is everything!

It was the only restaurant in the Bay Area that we came back to for a second time during our one week visit. Prices were also pretty comparable to the non-sustainable restaurants so this is our go to seafood spot in San Francisco for sure!

978,Marko M.,"Yelp said that they had some of the best cioppino, so decided to give this place a try before Alcatraz tour.  First, the layout of the tables and seating along with the decor makes you think that you're on a ship with windows on one side.  Didn't get to sit next to the window, but you can still see the piers, boats and the bay outside.  Now, the food and the food.  :)  Bread rolls are freshly baked sourdough, a San Francisco classic, just ask for extra butter.  Another SF classic is the cioppino, which a mixture of seafood in a mildly spicy tomato broth.  Got it lazy style, which is less messy as the crab is taken out of the shell.  All the hard work is done, all you have to do is enjoy every bite.  My fiancee got the sliders for lunch because she doesn't like seafood, they were really good.  Later on in the evening after the tour, we went in again and she tested the waters on the clam chowder bread bowl for dinner(I had cioppino again).  Don't go here, because you'll never want to eat anywhere else in SF again when it comes to seafood.

If I could only eat one burger for the rest of my life it would be that burger! It was literally the best I've had in a very long time! The burger is the only reason for the complete five stars. PS.

We were seated overlooking the little harbor and pier where the seals usually hang out so that made it even better.  I had the seared pacific cod with white beans, chorizo butter, roasted tomatoes, spinach, basil, cilantro, topped with a garlic shallot aioli.  The sauce was amazing!  So delicious I could have definitely had more and just sopped it up with some sourdough.  My girl had the Cioppino and could not stop commenting on how phenomenal it was.  She said it was definitely one of the highlights of the trip.  That being said....we'll definitely be back on our next San Fran adventure!

986,Deborah T.,"This review could of easily been a five star. The location of this restaurant is good. The wait on a Saturday afternoon was about 45 minutes. They take your name and will text you to start heading down to the resteraunt because your name will be called soon. When we arrived back someone tried to take our seats. They pronounced the name wrong so it was hard to recognize but I went up anyways to double check. Be careful and pay attention seems like some people are just rude and try and say they are that person unless your slick enough and pay attention then you won't get missed. Glad they were able to seat us anyhow. The people that tried to take our seats I  believe they brought them back.

The food was excellent. I felt bad because the guest I was with had hair in their food and had to get there food redone. I was surprised with such a fine restaurant they didn't automatically send over a manager to apologize. Instead they remade the food. We didn't get to enjoy our dinner together by the time they remade it. That was a bummer. Most resteraunt I've been to that messed up they actually care about there guests and there experience. Especially our tab was over $160 for only two people. You would think that management would of at least comped a desert. We said nothing at this point. I wasn't there to tell them how to run there restaurant and tell them what good service is thus far. 

We ordered clam chowder, shrimp cocktail, side of lobster tail, lobster tail plate and the seafood mix they were offering that day. The guest  I was with didn't really care for the shrimp on the seafood plate. I was shocked because he's a huge shrimp lover.

If you arrive at resteraunt they only will valet up to one hour for parking. We parked on the street. Usually we park in the parking lot. But parking can be like 13/ hr up to 48/day or on street you might luck out for $4.75 an hour. We seen one parking lot was like flat rate parking $35.

I'm sure we will be back. If it happens again I will assure you  not keeping my mouth closed and this will surely not be a 3 star review. The food was worth it granted they didn't have hair in there food. Disgusting

987,Sunny C.,"We ordered the bowl clam chowder and the lobster role. Then clam chowder was thick, creamy, and had lots of clams! The order came with warm sour dough bread so there is no need to order the bread bowl. She was also happy to refill our bread when we finished it. 

The lobster role was amazing! The brioche bread the lobster role came with was so good that we got two extra orders of just the bread to go. 

Would definitely come back next time I visit fishermans warf.

When we checked in at the hostess stand, she unapologetically said it would be a 15-30 min wait. She said the app really doesn't work and didn't seem to care that we were pissed. The manager nicely explained they were one of the 'trial' restaurants for the new Yelp feature and agreed that it had many flaws. He was able to find us a large booth to sit at immediately. The service was great and the food was excellent. But... the hostess was rude and we will never try the Yelp 'waitlist' again. We were there 6/19 at 2:00 pm

My mom had the Pacific Sole, the fish and vegetables were cooked to perfection...the potatoes, however, were over-cooked and dry; when we made our server aware, she graciously comped our Creme Brûlée dessert as well as giving a mini Creme Brûlée to my dad on a separate plate with ""Happy Birthday"" written in chocolate cocoa powder.  My daughter had the Pesto Chicken Penne and had so enjoyed the pesto sauce she left her plate clean! Upon seeing this, Jane made sure to bring her a small, take-home container of said sauce, making my daughter ecstatic with joy!

Although we weren't given the window table, it was still a very nice experience to be guided to your table by affable attendants. My kids ordered their salmon children's meal and they had a great time waiting for their meal because of the crayons and the coloring papers. For myself, I splurged on lobster tails and crab cakes to share. I had Anchor beer to wash it down. 

The lobster was fresh and just juicy. It was yummy! And the crab cakes! The kids really enjoyed their salmon and they said that it was the best they ever had! 

We didnt wait that long for the food and we also didnt dally long inside the restaurant. It was a splurge worth having!

1003,Kris S.,"We showed up midday for some lunch and beers.  The wait was only about 3-5 minutes which I found surprising considering that this place was SLAMMED.  And not in an annoying way, just that there were a TON of people eating and drinking here.  We were lucky enough to be sat at a two-top next to a window so we had a fantastic view.  This place is clean and very sharply appointed.  Once we were sat, I did take a bit longer than it should have for our server to come over - probably 8-10 minutes.  Once she did however, she was pretty on the spot.  We started with the 805 Blonde Ale, which was perfect for washing down the oysters and washing away a hangover. We also ordered a cup of chowder which was decent. It was way too thick but the flavor was good. Also, their bread was awesome.  Same sourdough flavor but in a warm roll with whipped butter. Not the cold hard loaf that some other places give you with nearly frozen pads of foil-wrapped butter. The menu was extensive and by the looks of those having full meals, pretty damn good.  I'd come back here for a full meal in the future.

The blue cheese garlic bread we shared [bc we're on vacay and don't care about being fatties] was yummy. Without the blue cheese atop the bread, it was like any other garlic bread--smothered in butter. And man was it expensive at $8.

The bf's crab roll, under the sandwich section, was really delicious. The poor roll was packed full of yumminess. It was flavorful and sort of oily. The accompanying fries were slightly crispy and yummy.

My choice of the seafood penne was great. There was a good mixture of various seafood goodies: mussels, clams, and some type of fish. There was a good ratio of meats to pasta.

I am on a pretty strict self imposed diet and I was waiting to get to Fisherman's Wharf to splurge.  I walked up to Fog Harbor during lunch time and the manager was really nice, he showed me the menu and specials and invited me in.  I decided to give it a go and all I gotta say is OMG!  The manager sat me at the window with a beautiful view of the harbor and sea lions. I started with the clam chowder which was amazing (I bet the sourdough bread bowl would have been incredible, but I didn't splurge on my diet that much).  Then I had the pumpkin curry salmon topped with prune jam and pumpkin seeds, served with spinach, sweet potatoes and fingerling potatoes from their specials menu and It was as good as it looks in the picture.  Oh, and per the suggestion of my server they added a scallop (yummy and HUGE).  The restaurant has a great ambience, beautiful view, the staff were friendly and the food was excellent!

Excited to try we had a party of four that was sat right away without any reservations. Our server Gia, was amazing and very very attentive to us. Being our first time, she gave us a lot of tips to what plates to go for and did not rush us at all. Her patience and kindness really made this dinner a great one! 

Of course, her recommendations are what we had to go with and everything she said tasted delicious! The calamari was to die for. It was perfectly cooked and the lemon aioli was mouth watering! I will be definitely dreaming of that dish. The clam chowder was next, and let me say- I could eat that every day. Hands down the best chowder there. No doubt about it. 

My entree was the mixed plate. I was having a difficult time deciding what to choose so Gia told me to get it all. I'm so happy I listened to her. The cod and salmon just melted in my mouth. One thing I can't stand is when fish taste fishy lol if you know what I mean - but both fishes BLEW me away. Shrimp and was tasty, but not as fresh as the fish- so my focus was on those two. Mashed Potatoes were soft and flavorful! I had no disappointments at all. 

We skipped dessert because we were stuffed! But I would recommend this place to all my friends - a little pricy... BUT WORTH IT! I promise you.

(Dont worry there is so much to do on the pier to keep you busy)

The food nothing short of mouth watering good! Some of the freshest seafood the bay area has to offer and on top of that the portions are monstrous.

Checked in at 5:55pm, we were walked to our tables, not a word from the person who walked us to our table apologizing for not having any seats by the window as requested prior to making the reservation. Okay, that's fine. 

For starters, we both started with a cup of clam chowder (this is what they're famous for!). The chowder was delicious until I came across a piece of hair midway into my soup. DISGUSTING!! How does that even happen?! 

I ordered the surf & turf, I give it a 4/5. The lobster tail was too chewy, like it was over cooked. My boyfriend ordered the shellfish platter + lobster tail. He said there were shells everywhere on his food that it was barley edible. There were tiny shells all over his food from the 1/2 crab.

1028,Quin N.,"My emotion was on a rollercoaster dining here. Rated four stars by over four thousand people, this place seemed awesome, not to mention all the mouth watering pictures. 
I went to another seafood place (less fancy tho) the day before and it was amazing. So I got to this place with full of expectation. The lady at the host stand greeted me and my mom with a smile. We got seated right away. Our table had a nice view of the harbor. I was still excited up to this point. 
Then the waiter came by, didn't introduce himself or whatever, just asked if we wanted to get started with any drinks. And, probably because I said I wanted a few more minutes to look at the menu, he suggested a few items. I love it when people give me recommendations. We then ordered a seafood platter for two with an additional lobster tail, and a caesar salad.
From this point on, the waiter seemed to avoid talking to us. He used body language. Yes, body language. And only when he needed to, or else he would disappear or wandered around other tables he was serving. I started to feel weird. At first I thought he might be a foreigner, that would explain why he didn't really talk to us and used body language. But he joked with the table next to me. That was when I noticed other waiters did introduce themselves to whomever they served. 
Oh boy, whatever. It's not like I need his attention for anything. I don't really care about how you serve people, as long as you are polite and the food is good. 
The seafood platter was good. Full of clams, mussels, shrimps, crabs and potatos. They were all fresh. The lobsters were bomb. I loved the potatoes. But I didn't like my caesar salad. It was a bit more sour than and caesar salad I've ever had. And you know what was funny? It had full romaine lettuce leaves. Is that art? Because it doesn't make the salad taste any better. My mom and I had to actually use the knives to cut it up. A romaine lettuce leave can be as big as my hand, so of course I'm never gonna put that whole thing into my mouth. And we had three croutons made from sourdough bread on top of the leaves. Not my favorite, but it's just my taste, I'm not complaining. 
I don't have any picture of the salad cuz I wasn't going to show it to anyone. I only take pictures of pretty dishes. I didn't even think about writing this review. But the waiter gave me a final strike. 
The moment I dropped my fork, didn't even finish wiping my hand, he appeared out of nowhere behind me asking if I've finished or was still eating. Shortly after cleaning up our table, he came with our check. I felt like he was trying to kick us out cuz customers were lining up waiting outside. He circled his name, Samir, and wrote ""Thank you!!"" 
CUTE. I love notes!
Our bill was about $140, so we were supposed to tip $22 which was 18%. I knew it, but I didn't want to because he didn't deserve that much. Remember his greeting style, body language and all the ignoring? After paying for our dinner, my mom happened to put a $10 bill on the table and the waiter saw that. He turned and showed us the suggested tips written on the bill. And I actually followed what he said. We tipped him $22 as he wanted. 
He picked up the check before we left, and threw us a ""xia xia"" (thank you in chinese). Excuse you gentleman, if you see this review, it's time for you to learn that not all Asian is Chinese. Now I think I understand, he might think we were Chinese and wouldn't understand English, so he didn't talk to us or want to have any interaction. We sat there for like a minutes afterwards thinking we were stupid to tip him that much. 
The food is not good enough to get me back to that place to be treated like that. Tell me I'm sensitive, but you don't want to pay over a hundred bucks to get yourself upset, right?

1030,Nicholas K.,"Visited the restaurant on a trip to San Francisco. Ordered their signature clam chowder in sourdough bread and a special order, the seafood pasta linguine. The chowder was good, savoury, taste is not overpowering and good amount of clams in it.  The pasta was amazing! The amount of seafood and variety in it shocked me. It had 5 scallops, 6/7 prawns, tons of clams, 5/6 mussels and half a crab. Came in a garlic butter sauce, great recommendation from my server. My server, Curtis was very attentive and friendly. Greatly appreciated his recommendations during ordering. Great service overall and will visit again.

Update: Being from AZ we decided to try Boudin the next day.  Fog Harbor rules!  It is not even close. The sour dough is fresher. The whipped  butter is so much better. And the chowder has a much better seasoning.

This restaurant will always have a place in my heart because this is where my fiance and I went with our family and friends right after we got engaged. They made us feel special and gave us a complimentary congratulations dessert which I didn't really expect but appreciated. There was a big group of us so we got to try a lot of different things.

The calamari and oysters were great!  Crab cakes were good but I've had better. THE CLAM CHOWDER WAS FANTASTIC!! I had to get it in the bread bowl to get the full effect and it was totally worth the carbs. My friend's salad was ginormous and my sister bought us a bottle of the finest champagne. The whole experience was memorable and the service was great. I would recommend making reservations because the place gets packed and for good reason.

We were so excited to visit this place on our trip but it just wasn't good. We ordered the $68 seafood platter and the fried calamari which both were not up to par. The fried calamari tasted not fresh and had no bite to it... i don't want to begin with the seafood platter.. my boyfriend broke into the lobster claw and his face puckered because it tasted bitter and spoiled. The seafood just didn't taste nor look fresh. Nothing on that platter tasted good. My boyfriend also tried their clam chowder which had crab on top which was half defrosted in which caused the whole soup to turn into a cold watery mess.The only good thing we had was the complimentary bread.

1043,Lorna Q.,"Very disappointed in this place. I ordered the seafood platter with the crab legs.. man were they terrible.

The crab tasted like AMMONIA. At first it wasn't bad at the opening of the leg but as you got to the meat, the chemical was so bad I had to spit it out. You could taste a little pine-sol. We immediately told the manager and they went ahead and brought us a new crab. Once again, the ammonia/chemical smell was prevalent. The manager told us that it's normal and that some crabs have it due to mating season (yeah ok).

I did my own research and apparently the ammonia smell is a byproduct of the decomposition of seafood. Possibly the crab was kept in a filthy tank. Crabs excrete ammonia instead of urine. 

So there you go, they kept a disgusting batch of crabs and still served it to customers. They gave us half off the dish which I don't think compensates for the time and tastebuds wasted. I will never come here again or recommend

1044,Karen H.,"Our first official meal in SF! Authentic good clam chowder is what he wanted in a sourdough bread bowl. This place had us sold when we read award winning chowder!

It was a tough choice since Fishermans Wharf is basically filled with a ton of great chowder places but this spot still won us over. You walk into a beautiful entrance with a seating area and fireplace. Past the bar and into the dining room. We got lucky and we were seated next to the window. It was on overcast chilly day but the view still looked spectacular. The chowder defiantly helped us to warm up before our bike ride to the bridge. The chowder was warm, thick and flavorful. It was not salty which is my main issues with clam chowders. They didn't skimp on any of the ingredients you see the huge chunks of clams. It wasn't watered down or runny. The spices really did come through nicely. We added extra crab meat for $7. I wish the crab meat was warmed before placing it on top of the chowder. I had to mix it into the chowder to warm it up. Then we ripped off pieces of the sourdough bread bowl to dip into the chowder. It was delicious just what we needed. We also had their complimentary sourdough bread and butter before our meal came out. Can't get enough carbs! Especially good sourdough! Calamari is another tricky dish that can go wrong. But not here! The hot plate of freshly fried calamari was so good! Lemon aioli was served instead of tarter sauce. The lemon aioli really made a huge difference especially with a freshly squeezed lemon over the calamari. The surprise kicker was the deep fried slices of jalapeños to give you a surprise kick of fire. I didn't even notice it until my BF pointed them out. I tried some of the smaller pieces of jalapeño and calamari dipped into the aioli ohhhh it was the best combo. 

Service was wonderful, server was on top of everything. Refilling waters and checking up on us. He was very knowledgeable and friendly. Great way to start off our trip with a bowl of award winning clam chowder! When you receive the bill they give you coffee crackers instead of mints to end your meal.

After exploring some of fisherman's wharf and pier 39 my boyfriend and I decided to stop here for lunch. The overall service was exceptional. Our waitress was super friendly and very helpful with making recommendations for us. 

Food wise I decided to go with the soup and salad combo while my bae picked the fish and chips. Before the meal we were also provided with complimentary sour dough bread and butter. It came out very fresh, hot & delicious. Once my meal arrived I surprisingly fall in love with the Caesar salad more then the chowder. The dressing was perfect and the romaine hearts were very crisp and tasty. I did enjoy my chowder as well, but would have liked to see more clams. For the fish and chips I managed to sneak in a few bites in and man oh man, it was spectacular. It almost made me regret my ordering decision.

1064,Jen M.,"After a great (but pricey) breakfast at Taylor Street Coffee Shop, a quick visit to the Golden Gate Bridge, and a leisurely stroll up and down Lombard street, we decided to walk to Fisherman's Wharf for a few hours before we head to Alcatraz.

After a couple hours of shopping, picture-taking, and people-watching, we decided to find a spot for drinks and snacks. I already had Fog Harbor in mind since the JW Marriott concierge highly recommended it when we had arrived, although I almost changed my mind when i saw how many people were waiting for a table! Took me almost 5 minutes just to get to the hostess to put my name in, and was told it would be at least a 45 minute wait. We decided to grab some drinks from the bar while we waited and luckily, a couple of spots opened up right at the bar!

The bartenders were all very professional and friendly. I started with a glass of prosecco then switched to syrah; hubby started and ended with syrah. We ended up ordering way too many drinks and only the crab cake app to share (delish!), but it came with some warm sourdough bread and butter - perfect for soaking up all that wine we consumed!

Great vibe overall, and we were definitely impressed with the efficient and friendly service, especially since we sat next to an older, much drunker and rowdier couple, and the bartenders were able to handle them extremely well without any sign of irritation. Sad that we weren't able to try more of their food - will have to go back the next time we're in SF!

Being a native of the Bay Area I always associated Pier 39 with overpriced parking and totally tourist trap restaurants.  Value, flavor, and good service in this area historically was very hard to come by.  

But alas, my wife was craving seafood and we were already on location so I said - why not?!   So my wife and I shared a shellfish platter for 2 and my kids shared the sliders appetizer.  The dinner also came with delicious warm sourdough - which was absolutely delicious - and went along perfectly with the shellfish platter's garlic/butter sauce - like a delicious slice of warm garlic bread MMMMMMMMmmmm...

The shellfish platter portion size was very generous, and the crab meat was tender and sweet.  I am a big fan of shellfish - and I felt the mussels and clams were absolutely wonderful!  Shrimp were on the smaller size - but still nice nonetheless.

The star of the show however was our waiter - Jose.  He was amazing in his attentiveness - he even brought out a live ""condemned"" lobster to cheer my crying daughter up.  He totally went the extra mile to make our experience incredibly memorable.   Kudos to Jose!

I think 3 stars is right on, as I wasn't necessarily disappointed with my experience, but it's wasn't anything to write home about either.

The best parts about the restaurant are the wait staff and the views of the bay. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating, and the large windows in the dining room ensure most tables have a great view of the bay and golden gate bridge. This is a great addition to the touristy area of Pier39, and I would say probably the best restaurant in the area. However, even for a ""tourist trap"" area, I was still surprised at some of the prices for the entrees, especially for A) the portion size and B) the quality. I wound up ordering the muscles and fries off the appetizer menu as an entrée, and have definitely had better in the city, even at non-seafood restaurants. I sampled the crab cakes and seafood sampler from others in our party and they were just a-OK. All in all, a great place for apps/drinks and to take in a view when you're in the neighborhood, but nothing I would make a cross-town, weeks in advance reservation for.

I strolled in at 5:30pm on a Monday and asked to be by the window so I could have a nice view. The host took me to the furthest seat from the window. I was practically next to the host stand at the front of the restaurant. Umm...no thanks. I asked to wait to be seated at a window instead. A guy, I assume a manager, although friendly, asked if I absolutely needed to be at a window. Umm...yes. 

25 minutes later I'm back, and I'm at a window seat. The view was worth the wait, and especially being a solo diner. 

I ordered an old fashion, half a dozen raw oysters, and the clam chowder in a sour dough bowl with a side salad. My old fashion came in a glass that was only half filled and full of pulp. Three of my six oysters were gritty as hell, and a couple had bits of broken shell. Not impressed. 

The clam chowder was decent, but not something I'd come back for. 

The server was nice, and the view was spectacular, but the prices and food were not worth it. I recommend maybe a drink and app, but go elsewhere for entrees.

As a Bay Area local I rarely dine at restaurants in this part of the city because the few I have tried were pretty disappointing, which is no huge surprise considering the area is a tourist magnet and always super busy. I was at the pier with  my kids over the weekend Pokemon hunting, and they were starving so we ventured into this place. The ambience was actually very nice, and though we had to wait, the outside patio had comfortable seating (and some outlets) so all was good. I glanced at the menu and the food selections seemed good with plenty of variety. Everything we ordered tasted great (the salad, chowder, salmon and cioppino were delicious). They have a nice bar with lots of options and draft beer. The best thing about this place, though, was our amazing server, Giha. She is the best! I  can sometimes be complicated when it comes to making decisions/finalizing orders/making special requests, and and Giha was completely sweet and accommodating the entire time. She made us feel totally comfortable and went out of her way to make sure everything was perfect. Best part - she was super nice to my kids. I will definitely be coming back to this place.

The oysters were so fresh and delicious! We both ordered the Cioppino and it was the best I have ever had. It was sooooo good. Our waitress was great as well! The service was wonderful. I recommend making a reservation! We did and it worked out great. The only reason we didn't give this 5 stars was due to the hostess. I can't remember her name -- she had black curly hair. She wasn't very nice to us and she was very rude to this other man. She's your restaurants first impression! I would fix that! Other than that, everything was amazing.

1085,Joanne Y.,"I came here on a Sunday after paying a visit to the SF MOMA nearby. The whole pier was pretty busy, so I was expecting a wait. The wait for a table was 30-40 minutes. It's convenient here because they'll send you a text once your table is ready. So put your number down and feel free to explore the pier a bit!

We ordered a bowl of clam chowder, the red chili garlic shrimp, the cioppino (A MUST GET), and the mixed grill. The clam chowder was delicious! I definitely can't finish a whole serving by myself as it's super hearty and creamy. The red chili garlic shrimp was pretty good - spicy and tangy. The cioppino was sooooo delicious. For $33; they definitely don't skip on the mussels, clams, fish, shrimp, crab, and scallops. This dish is served with what seems to be a piece of garlic bread but I bypassed eating that. The mixed grill consists of grilled salmon, swordfish, shrimp, veggies, and mashed potatoes. I didn't really try much of the mixed grill, but my friend really enjoyed it! 

The service here was pretty good too albeit it being bustling with patrons. I'll definitely be back to try different items on the menu! They do validate up to 1 hour for parking if you park in the garage nearby.

P.S. Ask for a picture menu to make your selection process a little easier :)

1086,Cynthia X.,"Hmmm about this place. It's ok, if you are a tourist and want to eat at the pier by the water, but then again, there are other options, and I'd prefer Scoma at Fishermans Wharf for the parking situation.

Fog Harbor Fish House - the food is very standard and mediocre, over priced of course, but that is expected. Knock off half a star.

It's hard to make reservations and the lines are always so long because of tourists. They'll validate you for the garage, but only for 1 hour, which is ridiculous because the wait itself would take up a lot of that time. The garage is then $9 and hour after that. Knock off half a star.

All the above can be forgiven because the view, BUT knocking off 2 stars because the service. Service was not great at all. We had reservations but was constantly reminded that the entire party had to be there, and that they would only hold our table for 15min. Our waitress was not the most attentive and served our entree and appetizers all at once (oh and the clam chowder in bread bowl last). Granted we were sharing everything among 9 people, but at least you could separate the appetizers / salads / soups and serve them first. 

Our table was so crowded, we didn't know where to start eating, and as we ate the appetizers, salads and soups, our entrees sat at the table getting cold.

1090,Angela H.,"Really nice late lunch, and we got to catch the Fleet Week air show with the Blue Angels from our table. That alone should be worthy of five stars, but I need to deduct a star for my food. I ordered the ahi tuna, which was supposed to be seared rare, but it was cooked maybe medium/medium-rare... the wasabi aioli was really nice, though, and the rice it came with was super tasty. I also had the hibiscus margarita, and that was bomb! apparently it's voted the best margarita in the city by SF Weekly, and it was easy to see why. I also enjoyed the bleu cheese garlic bread that we got for a starter, especially dipped in a little bit of the lemon aioli that came with the calamari starter.

So. Two starters, two drinks each, and two entrees came out to $135 pre-tax. We spent about two hours there (or just over), and had a good meal and good entertainment with the air show. expensive, but worthwhile. Had the tuna been actually rare, I'd have given this visit five stars.

1091,Ash S.,"Fog Fish Harbor House has a spectacular view of the water and is located in the heart of touristy fisherman's wharf. It is located on the second floor if you are searching for it.

I had the Mixed Grill, which included shrimp, salmon, and mahi mahi. I was also able to try the clam chowder bread bowl as well. I really enjoyed the sourdough bread along with the clam chowder. The salmon was the best item I had here. It was flavorful and juicy with a slight char that was not overpowering. The mahi mahi was a little dry and overcooked. The grilled shrimp had a nice charcoal to it like the salmon.

Thank you for your response. Im not sure how to leave a comment on a comment, so hopefully you get this.

1099,Zoe F.,"Came here because of the insane amount of reviews and rating. I was no disappointed!

First off, the view really makes this restaurant. If it wasn't for the view, I do not think it would be as popular as it is based off the food alone. The food was good, but in teams of seafood, there are much better places to eat.

We sat at the bar and loved every second of it. The bartenders working were both awesome. Two older guys who had huge personality and top notch service. We tried a few different things off the menu, but the clam chowder was the best hands down. Even though it's not the best I've had in the city, it did a pretty damn good job. The fish I had was tasty but everything else they threw on the plate really took away from the protein itself. My roommate had lobster, which he said was incredible. The drinks we ordered were are very sweet but tasty nonetheless. 

The line is insane. Make sure you are prepared to wait because you will and for a while. We were really lucky to find a seat at that bar almost immediately! If not, we would have waited at least 45 minutes for 2 people.

Curtiss was our waiter and took the time to ask where we were in town from and for what occasion. He made food and drink recommendations - we had the crab and scallop risotto and the panko crusted halibut, both seriously amazing. Curtiss also had a waiter in training assisting and he was very kind. Then, they gave us a dessert on the house for our anniversary! Excellent food and service.

The hostess was very accommodating and quoted us a reasonable waiting time. My party was seated partially (great, because I was starving!) I skimmed through the menu and told myself to try not to order everything on the menu. 

Views of the Alcatraz, Sf Bay, Golden Gate Bridge, so request a table by the window. 

Clam chowder with a side of their fresh house-made sourdough bread. I was delighted when I found out they were serving my favorite oysters that day, Miyagi's from British Columbia (plump, briny, deep cup, meaty, perfection!) an immediate dozen to begin please. Clams linguine with a generous portion of fresh clams. Garlic herb roasted dungeness crab comes pre-cracked with a side of veggies and potatoes. The fried platter came with a delicious lemon aioli sauce but the fried seafood was a miss though. Our server and the wait staff was awesome, attentive and nice. For desserts, there's no menu. They will bring you a whole tray of ""display"" desserts for you to select from. Love this idea. I went with the dessert duo of house-made vanilla bean creme brulee and warm chocolate fudge cake.

1103,Salil K.,"We were lucky enough to get a seat at a table that had a beautiful view of Alcatraz and the bay. Can't complain there! Fisherman's wharf is super touristy so I didn't have high expectations for this place. I'd say it was what I expected. I ordered the crab roll which was MASSIVE. The crab to bread ratio is kind of off but it really fills you up. Fries come with it so it was hard for me to finish everything. Pricey but it's seafood in a touristy area so what do you expect. 

This place seemed to be higher rated than most in the area so I'm glad I went here. One and done for me though.  Definitely ask for a table with a view it makes a difference!

1105,Racheal D.,"I am so happy I picked this place as our to go restaurant when my friend and I visited Pier 39.  Even though the wait was an hour long, it was well worth it!  Service here is impeccable and food here is amazing.

They start you off with complimentary sourdough bread and you might think complimentary bread won't be that special but let me tell you... this bread was SOOOOO GOOD.  It came wrapped in a towel to preserve the warmness.  The bread tears apart so effortlessly and it goes PERFECTLY with the butter they supply you with.

My friend and I ordered non-alcoholic drinks first.  We both got the Strawberry-Basil Nojito ($7.00).  This was made with fresh mint, basil and strawberries muddled with fresh lime juice, and soda water.  I could not stop drinking this - it was super fresh and rejuvenating.  I highly recommend!

For our entrees, we ordered the following:

Bowl of Clam Chowder ($8.00) - award winning clam chowder.  This was thick and creamy - very very tasty... paired with the sourdough bread - my god, HEAVEN!

Ahi Tuna Poke ($17.00) - marinated raw tuna, avocado, mango, sesame-soy sauce and wasabi aioli.  My first time having poke in the west coast and I was not disappointed.  They give you these sesame chips to go with the poke and it just blends so well with each other.

1/2 dozen of Oysters ($15.00) - pretty standard oysters... but definitely very fresh!

Mixed Grilled ($26.00) - grilled salmon, swordfish and shrimp, citrus beurre blanc, sautéed vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes.  Our server was nice enough to split this into two plates for my friend and I!  The swordfish was really soft and easy to eat, salmon was fresh as well.

Overall - I really enjoyed my experience here and will definitely come back when I visit SanFran again!

1107,Len M.,"This is my second visit to Fog Harbor.  Both times we've had delicious meals served by a highly efficient, friendly wait staff. 

Because it is on Pier 39, which is the tourist epi-center of the entire city of San Francisco (literally filled with mediocre restaurants and shops selling souvenirs) I initially thought this restaurant would be mediocre too.  I was wrong.

The restaurant is located right at the front of Pier 39 on the second story, west side.  Most tourists just keep going past the entrance to the pier and head deeper.  When we arrived at lunchtime, there was a big crowd waiting to get in.  the Hostess is at the front in a  refined, but crowded waiting area.  With people lined up to give their names and get on the list, I anticipated not being able to get in or make any sort of request for desired seating style.  the hostess was personable and informed us that we would have a fifteen or twenty minute wait (which was surprising considering how many people were there waiting).

They had a few nice chairs and couches to wait on, or you could lounge outside on the second deck and people watch or sit on a comfortable couch/lounge chair while waiting for your turn.  We were called and seated in a booth (as requested) in less time than anticipated - less than five minutes.

Our waiter was very friendly and highly efficient.  

My wife ordered a fried seafood combo plate - Shrimp, fish and calamari served with cole slaw and fries.  She raved about the taste.  I had a dish of clam chowder (exceptional even by frisco standards) and fried Scallops served with a garlic/jalapeno Aoli.  

All dishes were exceptionally well prepared, flavorful, large enough in quantity to either require a take home bag or leaving some on the plate uneaten.  The hot sour dough bread that arrived before our meal was fragrant and crusty - so delicious.

Each time I've been a guest here, I have been impressed with how this restaurant handles the high volume of customers without making them feel as though they're in a production line.  Everyone is seated quickly and service is comprehensive and thoughtful. It leaves you with a feeling of a fine dining experience with great food and service.

The time after the first few visits, the hostess had an unnecessary attitude with me. The time after that I ordered one of my favs on the menu: mussel fries, as an appetizer. However the mussels weren't cooked at all. I told the waiter that they weren't cooked, he seemed annoyed. Didn't really offer to recook them or anything, when he finally did offer...we told him that we didn't want them anymore since our main courses was about to come out. He was so pushy about about having the mussels again, so I said sure. But fyi, If theres raw mussels in my mouth...that kinda kills my appetite for mussels! However, the clam chowder bread bowl is kinda amazing, so ill give them credit where credit is due. Needless to say, my relationship with this restaurant is tumultuous.

I feel like we sat there for a long time though for just a meal and didn't end up having enough time to explore the Wharf.  

The food.. I had the mussels and they were a bit sandy and salty.  My friend said her linguine and clams were also a bit salty.  The fresh oysters were delicious though - can't go wrong with freshly shucked oysters with marinara, vinegar and horseradish!  The tuna poke was also very good and had good flavor.

The standout for me was the cod, the clam pasta had a very generous amount of clams and was deliciously garlicky. The clam chowder was perfect, creamy, and not overly salted with a good amount of clams.

One of my favorite dishes is the mixed plate- comes with shrimp, sea bass and salmon. There's so much flavor & mashed potatoes & asparagus to 
Accompany the seafood. Their mussel fries are a MUST DO, so much deliciousness in a bowl & make sure to get extra bread to dip in the broth afterwards. We basically lick our plates clean. Other great options are the : shellfish platter, crab roll, clam chowder bread bowl & ahi.

1135,Leeyen R.,"Beautiful view, and you won't have to wait if you come at lunchtime. It's by pier39 so is in the thick of tourist central, which makes it a great place to take your parents or anyone who is visiting San Francisco. You should call ahead to reserve a table by a window. 

Delicious bread (which is probably from nearby Bourdain) to start, and excellent seafood options from crab to cioppino to lobster to fish n chips to chowder. 

It's not a usual spot for locals to go, but is worth it for the view and the seafood.

1136,Brian J.,"My fiancée and I were looking for a good seafood place to eat lunch after walking around the fishermans wharf all morning. When we came across this place on yelp we were impressed with what they had so we gave it a a go.

First thing is that if you're coming for lunch on a Friday or weekend for that matter, expect to wait a while. I think we waited close to 45 min to be seated. No big deal as we just sat at the bar and killed time there. The only thing I regret is forgetting to request a window table to enjoy the view of the water. However looking back we probably would have waited longer and we were too hungry lol.

I had the garlic dungeoness crab... even though I ordered the half size, the waiter must have misheard me and got me the full order ($45). Fiancée had the mixed seafood which included grilled shrimp, grilled salmon, grilled swordfish. The crab was actually amazing! Well seasoned deep into the meat! And the crab was actually pretty meaty despite the size of it! The mixed seafood dish was really good especially the swordfish! We also shared a sourdough bread bowl with clam chowder, but nothing really too crazy about it IMO. 

Service was great, Despite the miscommunication about the crab. I didn't make a big deal about it because honestly I didn't feel like I had to. The food was great regardless.

Overall this place was really good and we would definitely be back! I would still have had the half crab because it was too much food for the full crab, but if you're going with a few people it probably would be good to share one whole crab.

1137,John Christopher P.,"this place is OKAY. 
prices are not cheap at all ,but reasonable due to its location. 


the steak is not that impressive, i prefer texas roadhouse for steak. 

their bread/biscuit is Okay i prefer the free bread at Lucilles BBq or cheesecake factory. 

in totality, my experience is OKAY 6/10 

its not the restaurant that i would love to go back and crave for their dish. 

its a restaurant that you would choose to meet your friends since this restaurant has the most reviews and easy to pick.

We ended up waiting for about two hours because the host accidentally cancelled our reservation when we checked in with her. Other than that, the seafood platter was really good, a tad bit salty,but the crab had soo much meat in it! I'd recommend that and the fish and chips. Great combo to share with someone!

1139,Nile R.,"This is an above average seafood restaurant, that has a fairly high price point. Very good food, but I do believe there is ample room for other seafood restaurants in the area to surpass it. I ordered the seared pacific cod, which was served in a chorizo butter sauce. Very delicious, as the fish was very flaky and had a perfect crisp to the crust. However, the white beans that were served alongside left much to be desired. Fingerling potatoes would have completed this dish in a much more satisfactory manner.

Our waiter, Jeremy, was great. The service was impeccable, as our waters were always filled, and the bread basket was quickly replaced. He was a very helpful waiter without feeling overbearing. 

I would suggest this place if you have time to stop at many other restaurants, but if you only have time/money for one, try somewhere else.

1146,Derek F.,"tl;dr surprisingly nice place for a (potential) tourist trap, platter was great, crab (cake) delicious.

I am always incredibly skeptical when going to a restaurant in the middle of a tourist trap like the Pier. But sometimes people, or restaurants, surprise you, and for that I am grateful.

We ordered the crab cake for appetizer, and that was too tasty and too quickly we had annihilated the plate. The seafood platter was incredible, not just simply boiled but with plenty of herbs, garlic, lemon to give it the perfect flavor which let the seafood speak for itself mostly, fresh as they are. The Dungeness crab that came with the platter was delectable.

Service for such a busy place was at some point a little spotty but that's really the best you can expect, and the view was a very nice bonus to a great meal. Would come back again, though I'd skip the whole Pier part.

1149,Juanita I.,"We ate a late lunch at Fog Harbor after arriving in San Francisco, jet lagged and hungry. It was around 2:30 and we were seated right away at a window overlooking the pier. The place was pleasantly busy. 

Our server was kind and pleasant. 

We started off with the calamari appetizer with lemon aioli and it was perfection. We asked for more aioli and it was brought with a smile. 

I ordered the Seafood Penne and again, it was perfection. Perfect pasta, creamy tomato sauce, shrimp, mussels, and clams. It truly satisfied.

My husband ordered the Fried Combo which is fried fish, calamari, and shrimp and while it was good it was nothing special. It came with fries.

For dessert we had the Blondie Sundae because hubby is a lover of all things Biscoff. Chocolate chip style brownie square with walnuts, topped with vanilla ice cream, biscoff cookie crumbles and a biscoff sweet spread drizzle. It was delicious! 

We also each had a yummy raspberry lemonade cocktail which I can't remember the name of. It was quite good. 

Very impressed with Fog Harbor and would eat here again!

1152,Miguel C.,"I hope my review can give this place and our amazing Server Shakura justice. Let's start off by saying we were extremely fortunate to be paired with Shakura for our dinner service. She was absolutely incredible with her hospitality, menu knowldege, recommendations, and patience (we had a large party with 3 children ages 3,5,6). She absolutely NAILED every dish she suggested. We had high expectations based on Yelp reviews and images but this place delivered every step of the way. Calamari was subtly seasoned with a perfect dipping sauce, Dungeness crab cakes incredible with a hint of spice, clam chowder topped with crab was amazing! Lobster sandwich had a dream toasted bread surrounding all the lobster goodness and the lazy cioppino capped it all off with 5 stars. Extremely happy with the dinner we had but again I can't emphasize enough how much better the experience was because of Shakura! Shes an absolute personable and lovely person. And the restaurant kitchen delivers on all aspects. This place will be permanently bookmarked for S.F. eats.

1156,Katrina Y.,"Out of all the restaurants they offer on pier 39, I am so happy I chose Fog Harbor Fish House on my recent trip to SF! Number one of course was the spectacular view on that perfect sunny Saturday. It was just perfect! Service was also phenomenal!


We ordered the mussel fries as a starter and clam chower bowls with crab meat. I am not a fan of mussels usually because I feel they are more on the dry side as oppose to clams, but THESE mussels were so moist and tender I've never had mussels like these before. The aioli sauce drizzled over the french fries were absolutely delicious! Sounds like a weird combo, but trust me, it is soooo good! The clam chowder I felt was a bit too thick, but it was still nonetheless delicious especially with the crab meat!

Main entrees we had the half garlic roasted crab, and penne seafood pasta. The roasted garlic crab came out perfect. Everything just broke apart perfectly, no need for any utensils to open up the crab legs. It was almost like a soft shell crab in a way. The tomato cream sauce in the Penne seafood pasta was perfect! I am not really a fan of tomato sauce pasta, and cream only sauce is a bit too heavy for me, so this was a perfect combo for it was not too tangy nor heavy. 

Our drinks were filled constantly and our waitress checked on us very often to make sure everything was good.

PLEASE give this place a try! WILL BE BACK!

1157,Joanne S.,"Every time my mom comes to SF I take her to get seafood at Fog Harbor Fish House. Great view of the bay and Alcatraz, located at Pier 39 so lots of touristy things to do within walking distance. Of course, with the tourist location comes tourist prices but it's not that bad. In terms of food, their award winning clam chowder is quite good (particularly with the added crab) 4/5. We usually come for the lobster (5/5 very fresh) and Dungeness crab (5/5 the garlic is seriously good! This is their best dish!); we have had some other dishes here and there that were reliably good but nothing that springs to mind 1-2 years later. Service is usually quite good and you can get seated usually within an hour even if there is a wait - no problem there's lots to do while you wait!

This time around we got the clam chowder again as well as the seared pacific cod and the mussel fries. The mussel fries were fabulous (5/5); being a seafood house you might not expect their fries to be top notch but they are, and the cream sauce was delicious. The Pacific Cod, which was the dish recommended by our waiter, was honestly our least favorite dish that we have tried here. I generally prefer for my cod to have that juicy, oily mouthfeel and the cod was a little dry, maybe due to the thickness of the fish (don't know if you can tell from the picture but it was about 1/4 inch thick when it arrived on the table). However our waiter was fabulous at everything else, including getting our check to us early as we had lost track of time and had an upcoming appointment.

My brother usually comes with us and always gets the burger because he doesn't like seafood. It's alright, but really why come to a seafood house for a burger? It does comes with those delicious fries.

Tl;dr: great views, great service, great area, generally great food. Get the clam chowder, lobster, mussel fries, and 100% get the Dungeness crab. Don't expect too much from the non-seafood options. Expect tourist prices given it's a tourist location; to me it's worth a few extra bucks a dish if we are going to be hanging out at the piers for the day anyway. We will be coming back!

My boyfriend and I wanted to taste a little bit of everything without spending a lot, so we decided to share. We shared a ""cup"" size chowder and ""Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail"". For myself I ordered the  ""Garlic Whole Dungeness Crab"" and he got the ""Shellfish Platter"". Overall we spent $130 not including tip. Quite an expensive meal but definitely worth it. 

CHOWDER: 10/10 cup size was perfect to share. Get a little taste without getting full. 
SHRIMP COCKTAIL: 10/10 very refreshing 
GARLIC WHOLE DUNGENESS CRAB: 10/10 very garlic flavored potatoes and broccoli. The garlic on the crab was just right, not overpowering. Enough to satisfy you and still have room for dessert. 
SHELLFISH PLATTER: 8/10 boyfriend thought some of the crab pieces were dry. He liked the meaty mussels though.

Our server was Sara, she was very optimistic and outgoing. She got everything we needed right away and did not hesitate to do so. We both ordered pasta, I got the chicken penne and he got the linguini & clams. My chicken penne was extremely bland. I had to pour so much black peppers and salt to get some sort of flavor in my dish. My boyfriends entree was really good though. 

It was my birthday dinner and I told my server that. She went out of her way and brought every different dessert they had in the back and let me pick what I wanted, which was very nice of her. The bill came out to be about $42, including my birthday discount. And the free complimentary birthday dessert. 

When I come back next time, I'm definitely going to try their steak instead!

1166,Kathy N.,"Disclaimer: Despite the fact that this restaurant has $$$, high stars and looks nice, you can totally get away with dressing casually!! 

The pricing of the dishes here were definitely a bit steep. 

We had gotten a dozen of the raw oysters which was served with some type of vinaigrette and also cocktail sauce w/ horseradish. It was basically your typical raw oysters - it wasnt specified what type of oysters they were. $34 for 12 oysters. 

Ahi Tuna Poke $18 - Loved the flavors in this! It was very fresh tuna served with some chopped mangoes. I thought the mangoes were a nice touch to balance out the flavors. Great appetizer to start out our meal with.

Clam Chowder w/ Crab - got the cup size to try ($7), to add crab was an additional $7, but well worth it! Had to really get that seafood experience, right? The chowder was good on its own, but the crab added an extra umph and texture. I enjoyed it. Their chowder was also rewarded best in SF! 

Seafood Penne $23 - The sauce for this was really favorable, but it didnt exactly ""wow"" me. The overall portion of the dish looked to be large, but once you get into it there was not a lot of penne within the actual dish. However, there was definitely a decent amount of seafood to compensate! For a small girl, i found that this dish was just enough for me. 

Alaskan Halibut $34 - This was part of their seafood menu. A bit of a disappointment. Although the fish was very soft and fresh, it lacked flavor. We are more so people who enjoy more flavor in our dishes. Had to use sauce from the pasta so the fish wouldnt be so bland. 

Apple Crisp $8.50 - We came here for our anniversary, so they gave us a complimentary dessert. So nice of them! At the end of your meal, the server will come out with a tray of desserts to choose from - you select the one you want and they will prepare you a new one from the back. I was silly and was about to grab it right off the tray. The Apple Crisp was delicious. Not too sweet and served with vanilla ice cream. Unfortunately, i was too full from the dinner that i couldnt finish the dessert - which never happens.

For being a high rating restaurant with steep prices, I would have taken this place to be a more upscale restaurant, but its a great spot to come for any occasion at any time of the day.

Our waitress, didn't catch her name, was polite, courteous, and friendly, she never neglected the table. She always came back every 10 minutes or so, despite the restaurant being fairly busy, to check and make sure everything was okay and refill our drinks. 
The food was pretty good too, we all ordered something different, the seared cod that I had was great, but what blew me away was the tomato and sauce that was on it, so flavorful! We also shared some fried calamari with jalapeño as an appetizer which we gobbled like it was our last meal. Keep in mind though, the food is a bit on the pricey side, so it's not ideal for large families on a tight budget. 
The view and pictures can't be beat either, right by the water with a view of the bay, Alcatraz, ships, and the city. 
The only criticism I would have is there was a bit of a foul smell throughout the place, but given it is a seafood restaurant it's understandable and you get over it quickly. 
Otherwise, I recommend this place to anyone! We loved our experience here, and it's worth a try!

I started with the scampi cocktail which contained almost still frozen farm raised scampi presented in a way that was quite obviously prepared days in advance. I didn't finish. The spouse had the chowder which wasn't rated as highly as before, whole crab which was rated marginal. I ordered the salmon, not expecting a farm raised toxic tasting anemic looking filet I couldn't finish. The sides were regular Denny's quality, nothing special. The deserts were uninspired previously frozen items one would find at Costco. All of this would be fine if this place didn't tout itself as world class seafood. Our server was only seen once, for the remainder of the meal we seemed to have been taken over by food runners and bus staff.  The bill was of course close to $200. I deleted a previous review generalizing our experience after received a reply from management requesting details because it ""wasn't the sort of review they were accustomed to"" so here you are. I should have checked with my employees or any long term SanFran resident, in advance; it's common knowledge this is a visitor/ tourist/view restaurant only.

OMG when it came out it was huge.  the plate was the size of me! and that was just for 1 person.  they have an option for 2 people.  i cant imagine how big that would be.  it came with lots of shrimp, mussels, clams, half crab, potatoes, and the whole bottom was full of garlic noodle.  everything was delicious.  the fish n chips had 3 huge fish very plump with a lot of fries.  we were dying trying to finish it all.  but in the end the quantity was too much for us.  had to throw in the towel.  and dessert? forget about it.  couldnt move.  the prices are okay i mean its seafood so its gonna be a little more on the high side.  overall it surpassed my expectations.

1189,Evan K.,"We ate here late on a Wednesday, and they held our reservation for nearly an hour so we had a table to eat at instead of the bar. I had the Shellfish Stack, which was wonderfully garlicky and messy. They give you a bib, which I grudgingly but wisely wore. The service was attentive and thoughtful. This is a nice spot on Pier 39. I'd say it's a step above most of the touristy spots in that area.

1190,Shannon H.,"This place is such a tourist trap and I fell right in.

I am new to the bay area and had some friends visiting san francisco for a wedding. We decided to grab dinner and so after scouting out a few places I landed on Fog Harbor Fish House. The wait wasn't crazy long, maybe 10-15 minutes on a Saturday at 5ish. We also opted for seating by the water or not, whichever was available first.

The food is good but fairly standard and for the prices and the yelp rapport this place has I expected a bit more. The seafood was fresh but, I mean, you're on fisherman's wharf and the seafood is fresh at most places around here. The food is well done (though a little oily imo) but you can get that at a lot of places along the embarcadero. You wouldn't get a bad meal eating here, just not a stellar one. For san francisco and especially for downtown/embarcadero, keep looking.

Ps. Biscoff coffee house is downstairs from this restaurant and their coffee is really yummy (whole bean or brewed for you). If you're a cookie butter fan, it's a must try. :)

1193,Robert F.,"Decided to go out on Saturday night down to Pier 39 to feast on some good seafood and this placed was the destination. I thought initially it would be a good idea to make a reservation because I thought it would be busy but when I called the lady on the line indicated that the only times available would be around 10:00 pm and that if I arrived early there would be plenty of seating. So, I arrived around 7:00 pm and waited in line briefly before being met by the hostess. When I finally asked about a table to hostess told me it would be about a 30 to 45 minutes wait for a table!!! At this point, I am so disappointed in having to wait because I was initially told that there would be tables available.

I give my name and phone number to be notified when my table will be ready. I then proceed to take my seat and wait. The system that they have here is that the will text you or call you when your table is ready if you are not in the area. One nice thing is that the staff said that the wait may be shorter than the estimated time that they provided which I found to be a bit comforting. As I wait I take a few pictures admire backdrop of the bay and the sights at the Pier. After 45 minutes go by I proceed to the hostess and ask if my table is ready. She then asks for my name and then looks through the names. She then says that she does not see my name. Then she proceeds to ask me who took my name and number and tell her that she took it. Apparently, according to her, she called out the name earlier and someone took my spot. WHAT!!! My next question is did she check the ID? I get a blank stare and no answer, figures! What is the point of taking the name and phone number if you are not going to verify this information, come on man!!!! At this point, she apologizes and says it will be five minutes. At this point, I am just infuriated and disgusted by the madness of trying to get a table. 

Eventually, I am seated and ready to order. My server Adam was the best! He is the sole reason why this rating is so high. He was absolutely phenomenal. His recommendations were helpful and made my meal decision a whole lot easier. His timing to check-in was right on and the dessert tray was incredible. Unfortunately, I did not order dessert because my food was so good and I was stuffed. But, had I ordered a smaller meal I most definitely would have gotten a least one or everything from the dessert tray. 

Overall, the food was great but getting inside was just so much of a hassle and a pain. It is a good thing that servers like Adam work here because he really made the visit here worth it. I cannot say that about anyone else.

1194,Elliott Q.,"There are lots of restaurants can cook crab or lobster, but we don't know which one is excellent. So through yelp , we chose this one.
We ordered 2 whole dungeness crabs, one is original and the other is garlic. We also ordered lobster ETC.
The best is dungeness crab, but they are not alive before cooking, died few hours ago. If they were staying alive before cooking would be perfect.
The situation and service here are also good .

1195,Gigi D.,"I came across this place by walking around the wharf. We wanted to sit at the bar initially but was accommodated quickly when we changed our mind to sit at a table. Pretty busy for a Thursday afternoon, but worth it for beautiful view. Our waiter was friendly and pleasant. We were in between meals so we ordered, crab cake appetizer, a cup of clam chowder, and a bread bowl chowder with added crab. Everything tasted absolutely delicious! The table next to us had ordered a salad with crab and it looked delicious. I wish I had room to order and eat it myself. This place is definitely worth dining at for any occasion.

1200,Katie R.,"This place could easily be great - location, ambiance, and food for the most are on point. Unfortunately we had a group of six with a space cadet server. Though the bartender, bread/water service and a check in from the manager seemed alert, the bulk of our dining experience fell short. 
Oysters were a disappointment - small and flavorless. The sourdough bread  is fantastic! Calamari was a Bret variety with delicious jalapeños and onion straws mixed in. Muscle fries were unique and much better than the oysters but I wouldn't get them again. The chowder however was fantastic and worth the visit. Adding crab meat to the salad was clutch and easily enough to top the salad and toss in the soup. 
Overall, could be improved. It's disappointing it wasn't a better experience but they have plenty of redeeming aspects to make it a decent option if you're in the area.

The views from the restaurant of the bay were great, only knock on this place was price.  But I guess your also paying for the real estate on which you sit.

The space is huge; Even with no reservation on a Friday night we got a table for 3 in 10-15 minutes, so not a crazy long wait. Service was quick too, which is not often the case in a big space.

The spicy red chilli shrimp and garlic roasted crab were excellent!

There are four scallops that are beautifully cooked, and they were seasoned perfectly. The risotto itself was great, but I feel like it could've had a bit more flavor. If you can go, definitely go, and try those things listed above, especially the crab risotto. You can enjoy the view while having a delicious meal!

1216,Jatin K.,"I had read many reviews before I got here and decided to give it a whirl. This was our first stop when we arrived to fisherman's wharf, we had a party of 9 about 230 pm on a Friday afternoon and were seated right away on the window side. We all sat down ordered a bunch of drinks and appetizers, at first I feel like the waitress was a little annoyed and wanted to rush us out of there but then later she did end her shift while we were still there so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt on that one. This was hands down some of the best seafood I've had. The calamari was delicious and perfectly cooked. The oysters were the most fresh delicious oysters I've ever had. The whole table tried an oyster even the people who aren't oyster lovers. We ordered the sliders which had such a delicious sauce on them which made them absolutely amazing. The blue cheese garlic bread was a nice touch on the menu however the taste doesn't really match the concept of this place. Overall the service was decent, the food was amazing and the view was awesome.

1218,Eric P.,"Went here for lunch after reading some of the reviews for this place. It was only moderately busy around noon on a Monday, so I got immediately seated next to a window with a view of the water. 

The server was attentive and suggested I try one of the specials that just started this week... More on that later. 

I had the clam chowder with sourdough on the side to start. I've had a lot of clam chowders in my day, and this by far is one of the best if not best I've ever had. Not too dairy creamy... Tons of clam meat... Not overloaded with potatoes and seasoned just right. The hot sourdough bread was also very tasty... Served piping hot and fresh. 

Now for my main entree I had the king salmon special. What can I say? Pine nuts, avocado, orzo, locally caught king salmon, fennel, and a nice salad... Talk about explosion of flavor. Besides the salad/orzo combination being amazing by itself, the king salmon was cooked to perfection... With a delicate texture, nice seasoned crust and that bright red color... All in all a very good piece of fish. 

The only downside to this place is the cost, but you get what you pay for. I'd highly recommend those of you in the area visiting to give this place a try. I'll definitely be back!

With all the options of clam chowder all over pier 39, this one is a few more dollars and slightly smaller but still tasted pretty good. It's a nice place to dine away from all the tourist and birds flying all over the place. The crab roll we ordered was tasty on top of a perfectly toasted bread. We noticed all the other food options available that was being eaten and they all looked good. You definitely can't go wrong with eating seafood here. The wait was about 30 minutes around noon time on a Friday which wasn't too bad at all. Definitely want to try the other items on the menu but the clam chowder is definitely a must while in San Francisco.

I usually try my best to avoid restaurants in tourist dense areas. When my wife and friends wanted to go here, I threw on a smile and said ok... Prepared for the worst.

The menu had alot of options, and portions seemed fairly. I ordered the clam chowder and crab roll. 

They were both delicious. I was amazed. I even saved some of the rolls they bring you for the chowder. Boy was I in heaven. 

The place, although nice is packed with tourist, however the restaurant is bright and provides a gorgeous view of the Bay. Usually a wait for lunch however I think that it is actually worth it. If I was a local I wouldn't be horrified to bring my friends here.

The waitress brought our drinks and a basket of warm sliced sourdough bread with a tray of butter.  It was the best bread during our stay in SF because it was so warm and soft.  

I then ordered the Caesar salad which was dressed nicely, had a nice salty taste from the anchovies in the dressing and had killer garlic croutons that I could've eaten like popcorn.  The salad was plenty big enough to share with my eye candy.  I also ordered the Ahi entree which was a hefty ahi tuna steak encrusted in black and white sesame seeds and cooked to perfection and rare inside.  The was sitting on top of a bed of toasted and seasoned rice and an array of sautéed vegetables including bok choy which was so tasty.  

My husband ordered the sole which was sautéed and served in a caper sauce and atop of vegetables and fingerling potatoes.  

We were both very satisfied and full at the end of the meal.  The bill came with biscoff cookies which were a nice treat as well.  The hostesses were friendly, the manager checked in on the tables and our server was friendly and attentive.

In the old days, u would get soup and/or salad included w/ ur entree @ a nice restaurant like this. Now everyone is doing the upscale steak house style and charging u a la cart. The restaurant quality is not high enough 4 this style of menu, but again it is good food. Lastly and not that I usually care and it is CA, but some ppl were so underdressed for a restaurant that apparently wants to up upper scale that it was shameful. If u want to go to a linen table cloth restaurant with $40-$50 plate and wait staff in formal wear, then leave ur tank top, wife beater tee shirt, and other ghetto clothes @ home and @ least put on a tee shirt and jeans.

We had Ashley as our server and she was awesome.  We were seated at a table by the window and the view was great.   

After four days in Napa, I was wined out and went with the Cucumber Basil gimlet.  They were delicious.  My husband had one of the local draft beers.   We were given yummy warm sourdough bread and butter.  

Since I'm such a carb hound, I went with the soup and salad combo, which consisted of clam chowder in a bread bowl and a ceasar salad that I added grilled shrimp to.  The chowder was OK. Not great, just OK.  The rest was really good though and once I started dipping pieces of bread in the chowder, I had no complaints.

1251,Diana S.,"Our group got here on a busy Monday evening without a reservation and waited for 15-minutes and that wasn't so bad.  

We ordered our meals and waited extremely long for our orders to come, maybe about a half an hour.  But, I was satisfied when my award winning clam chowder was served.  It was piping hot and the clams tasted so fresh and the chowder was rich, creamy, and very flavorful.  I had it with the sour dough bread that was given at our table.  What helped with the long wait was watching the beautiful sunset turning from orange to pink and the sun finally setting.  My group of 5 all stood up to get some pictures.  

We eventually all got our entrees another half an hour later.  My Salmon ""Club"" Salad was very good.  The portion of salmon was prepared just right.  It was moist and flaky.  The lemon vinaigrette mixed in the salad was nice and tart and the lemon ranch dressing on top of the salmon enhanced the already freshness of the fish.  I enjoyed the onions, cherry tomatoes and bacon bits throughout the dish.  This dish was pricey for a salad, $20, but well worth it.

Next we were waiting for our check to come.  It was a long wait.  Our waitress apologized for our wait and her Manager decided to give us complimentary desserts for our time.  He also came to apologize for our wait.  We all ordered blondies to go.  I actually wanted to get the creme brûlé but that wouldn't be practical to take out.  

So, I gave our experience a 4 since we had great service recovery, and the meal and scenic view was fine.  If you don't mind waiting, this place is very good.

1254,Jennifer D.,"For being in a ridiculously touristy place I was very pleasantly surprised.  They give you some crazy good, fresh baked sourdough bread when you sit down (you can watch them making it from the window outside the restaurant).  My husband ordered some kind of fish stew thing and I had a wedge salad.  Both were excellent.  Drinks were also really well made and they didn't skimp on the alcohol. 
Service was very fast and attentive and it was pretty busy when we sat down for lunch.

Best meal of our entire trip! Whenever we are in the Bay Area, we all decided this is always a must have.

1258,Jean K.,"Fancy restaurant on the Fisherman's Wharf. It's located on the second floor and they have their own restroom! I came to Fog Harbor for their claim to have the best clam chowder. Yes, it was good but I don't think it lived up to the hype. A local told us a placed called Chowders will have the best clam chowder.

We also got half dozen of oysters and that was delicious! It was also $17 for half dozen... which In my opinion is expensive. The views were lovely. Would I come back to this place? I'm not sure but it was definitely worth a try and to check it off my list. It is mostly a tourist attraction.

1259,Julie S.,"This place was great! We stumbled in here after doing some sight seeing, yes it's a huge tourist place, but whatever they still have great food! The place is a lot bigger than I thought it was going to be from the outside, and really had a great ambiance to the place. It was classy but not too fancy where I felt like I should have dressed up. They have a great view of the water, and the wait staff was very helpful.

We got the spicy shrimp appetizer, and it definitely was spicy!! Not overbearing, but if you don't like spicy food definitely stay away. It's not one of those things on the menu that just says spicy and then there's nothing to it. My dad got the fried shrimp - which was your typical fried shrimp, nothing outstanding, but nothing bad to say. I thought they could have been a little less bread like, I hate when places drench their shrimp in batter. I got the chicken, which my dad thought was weird since we're at a seafood place, however it was fantastic! So juicy, great sauce and the mashed potatoes were fabulous. The only complaint that I have is they left the layer of fat on the chicken breast, which I understand is great for flavor, but if you're going to do so make sure you render the fat down more!

Great place to go, a little pricier than some of the restaurants down there, but not outrageous!

1262,Stanley Y.,"This place could've been a 4 star... but why in the world do they serve whole leaf lettuce in their caesar salad? Besides that, their clam chowder is the best I've ever had. The piping hot temperature they serve it at and the fresh clams in there make all the difference. The calamari was great as well. 

As expected of a tourist focused restaurant located on Pier 39, wait times can skyrocket. The servers were all very accommodating and the host even got us a window seat. You should come here for a view during lunch since the sun shines straight in and they put up blinds during dinner. The severs and place itself try too hard to create an 'upscale' dining experience while catering mostly to passing tourists who are dressed in everything from flip flops to dress shoes.

I come from a city that boasts some of the best fresh local fish so this is a must to me. On top of the flavor the prices were unbelievable. Convinced that traveling in California was going to be expensive I totally over budgeted for food on this trip.

It's a really nice restaurant amongst all of the casual tourist spots in the same area. I got the mixed grill and my husband got the ahi tuna dish.  I was underwhelmed by my dish. The mixed grill consisted of shrimp, swordfish, and salmon. The best fish on my plate was the shrimp. The other fish were dry and overcooked. 

My husband's ahi was good. The flavors came together well to make a good dish.

This was an unfortunate and regrettable choice to celebrate my mom's birthday.  Probably would've gotten better service at McDonald's.  And no...I would not step foot or recommend this establishment.


(In response to Bob's comments below:  thank you for your response concerning my feedback.  We were there 12/30/2018. Server: Asia.  In addition, a man with glasses approached us at the table in response to my text regarding the poor service.  I'm assuming he's the floor manager.

- strawberry basil nojito(non alcohol) : very sweet and fresh. I forgot to ask for little ice. It was literally full of ice that my drink was gone after two sips....:( 

- res chili garlic shrimp : our server warned us that it is very spicy......are you kidding me!? Not spicy at all! Booo but it was good. The plate itself was small but there were many shrimps and vegetables to share with. This was perfect with blue cheese garlic bread. 

- clam chowder : AWARD WINNING! No wonder! One of the best clam chowder I've ever had. But please order this with a cup or a regular bowl(not the bread bowl) and eat it with blue cheese garlic bread. I mean, unless you want to eat lots of breads...

- blue cheese garlic bread : the BEST dish I had here. I love love cheese and garlic and how can you go wrong when you have them with a bread!? And if you add clam chowder here...? Heavenly! But the bread is really big, big enough to share with 3people.

- lobster tail : chewy and fresh, but mashed potato and broccoli was meh :/ i ended up leaving all of them. It tasted like they didn't add any seasoning. 

- cioppino : I didn't get to try this but looked amazing. My husband said it's good but not amazing. I recommend you to order ""lazy"" one though...so that you don't need to deal with crab shells haha

Overall, it was great!

I was skeptical about falling into a tourist trap but really felt that I had a fine dinner against all odds! We went here on a whim on a Wednesday evening and it was still pretty busy but we were seated immediately. In spite of the touristy location the vibe was not chintzy or oversold and instead of just enjoying the view as a consolation we also enjoyed our meal and the service very much. There is something on the menu for almost any palate. The food was delicious and nicely presented. I had the salmon at our servers recommendation and thoroughly enjoyed it.

Since this store is really in middle of tourist spot, the store is busy most of the time. But the waiting time is not bad considered they are busy. The clam chowder are in bread bowl and taste is good just not the best for me. The non-alcohol drinks are interesting and taste good. The main dish and is the Bomb for me is the seafood platter. Everything in seafood platter are great, the clams, the Mussels, the Shrimp, the crab legs and the Flavored that come with it.

Huge plus to have that as an option for customers, that way you don't have to stay at the restaurant. 

After being seated it took about 8-10 minutes for our server to finally get our drink order and another 5 minutes to get our drinks. The server seemed to be a little overwhelmed, but we understood because of how busy it was.

We've eaten at most all the big restaurants down at the central area at Pier 45, Scioto's, Alioto's, Tarantino's, etc, and I was always left a little disappointed with the atmosphere, service, view, etc.  But Fog Harbor nailed all those and I think the views from there far surpass any other place we've eaten down on the wharf.  Of course the clam chowder is off the hook, probably the best I've ever had anywhere, especially when topped with the crab meat, but it was all really good. And the service and atmosphere were right on point too.  The first night we had Michael and he was really laid back and timely, the second night Jeremy took care of us and he was very open and very informative.  Two completely different styles but both outstanding in their own way.  I could go on and on, but both meals were just amazing, views from every seat, even though we waited both nights for a window seat, and just a great, great time on the wharf.

1303,Natalie K.,"This restaurant offers nice views overlooking the water, delicious food, and great drinks. 
We came here after taking a tour of Alcatraz, it's literally a 10 min walk from pier 33 or a 4 min cab ride. I live in a city where I have to drive everywhere and come from a city where I walked 80% of the time, so we opted out for a walk. 
The restaurant's decor is rather fancy, though I was dressed pretty casually, I did not feel out of place. Everyone here seems chill, no judgmental stares. 
As far as food, the Huns had NY steak with veggies and mash, I opted for a bread bowl with crab (I was told I MUST have chowder when in San Fran, so I took this as an opportunity to do so). Our waitress asked if we wanted a bread basket while we wait, we did. By the time food came out, the Huns had almost all the bread. I wasn't going for bread since I was going to have plenty in my meal. Even though food took a little while, it was delicious! The streak was spectacular, it had the grilled taste Huns looks for. My bowl was delicious as well, with crab stacked on top. It doesn't originally come with crab but you can add it for $7. A little messy since I tried to rip off pieces of the bread bowl. 
Drinks were great too. I tried the Alcatraz since we were coming from there (corny, I know). It could of been stronger but it was still good. It was also my second drink and I was a little buzzed from the first. I usually don't feel the alcohol in my second drink as much. Especially since my first had tequillaaaaaaa (you have to sing it and shake your shoulders, it's a law). 
I give 4 stars because our waitress was pretty bland. It felt like she had an attitude up until the end, when it came to a tip... then she turned into a Chatty Cathy, asking us about where we are from and telling us she has to pay $1,000 worth of tickets tomorrow... mmhhhhhmmmm, right... I saw her do exactly the same thing to a table next to ours. Oh, and when their drink spilled, she stood on the side allowing other servers clean it up and grinned. It was the first sight of happiness I saw from her. I mean, don't be so obvious!

1304,Ruchi S.,"Pier 39 is synonymous to San Francisco. It is full of restaurants and shops. I have very fond memories of pier 39. Having clam chowder and enjoying the endless beauty of sea.. Divine. During my last visit, I got a chance to try out this restaurant. All the seats with sea view were taken, so we were escorted to the dining area in between. The menu had loads of seafood options to choose from. My husband and I settled with red chili garlic shrimp and Cioppino. Cioppino was developed by Italian immigrants in San Fracncisco, so I had to try it. 
Service was good. Red chili garlic shrimps were perfectly cooked. They were not as spicy as I thought they would be. Cioppino tasted really good and had a variety of sea food. 
Both the dishes tasted great. Next time, I will try other items off menu.

1306,Blake C.,"I give it three stars because it's just a three-star restaurant. Mainly because everything was mediocre and the price was high. 

It was OK. You have a spare is OK. The food is OK. The service is decent. Nothing spectacular about the restaurant. 

The bread was really good. I can get I can give them high remarks on that.  The wedge salad was also really tasty. 

The steak has an interesting taste.  They use teriyaki sauce or some kind of tangy sauce to spread on the steak.

1310,Carl T.,"A delicious and relaxing place. This was my favorite restaurant while in San Francisco. 
This was our first day in San Francisco, we stumbled onto this while walking around Fisherman's Wharf and I am glad we did. We decided to come here for dinner. We had to wait for a table but that was fine by us. Every table has a view of the water. The staff was warm, friendly and helpful, and we were soon digging into delicious freshly baked sourdough bread, enjoying our drinks, and looking forward to our fish. The meal, which was served quickly, was very good, tasty and plentiful!  I had the cioppino, and it was chock full of seafood in a beautifully seasoned broth. My wife had the Dungeness crab in garlic butter, the flavors bounced off the plate.
We loved it so much we went back next day. We enjoyed the beautiful view of the Bay and the sunset along with an outstanding meal. 
I would highly recommend this for a wonderful waterfront seafood experience while in San Francisco.

Overall I would have to say pretty disappointed with the quality of the food. I was thinking since many of the yelp reviews were good and the pictures looked amazing - this place would be great. I was pretty inaccurate in that assumption as the fish was dry, steak was bland, and steamed broccoli was crunchier then a potato chip. The only thing that was decent were the mashed potatoes. I wish my wife and I had stuck with our original plan to go to Scoma's for lunch - now that place is amazing!!

1313,Linda M.,"We attended the Fog Harbor Fish House on Mother's Day. And the service was absolutely lousy. The food came to the table cold, which had to be returned to be reheated. I had mussels and fries and the shelves were empty and mounted on a small bed of french fries I do not know where the muscles were so that had to be sent back. I've had the mussels and Fries in the past and they were mounted beautiful on a hugh bed of french fries with a very delicious sauce ( but I ordered from the bar, I think when you order from the bar you get better food and service). This rendition of mussels and fries was a loser by all standards the muscles were very small after returning them to the manager that is what he brought me out mussels in the shell but the smallest that he could find. The calamari was fried hard and was very salty. That too had to be sent back. My mother ordered  Caesar's crab salad, and the salad had canned crab  on it. Being that the restaurant sits right on the wharf we're fresh crab is serve, Dungeness crab, you would think they wouldn't be so cheap as to serve can crab; they would use fresh Dungeness crab on their salads. But that was not the case with her salad last night. Fog Harbor Fish House is cutting corners  at every angle to save money  which is bad for the dining experience. My sister ordered a lobster for $25 and got about a 2.5-oz lobster tail that had to be sent back. The clam chowder is very thick mother said it tasted like gravy. She did not like it at all. My husband ordered a steak  and it had no seasoning on it whatsoever he had to load it down with salt and pepper. Mashed potatoes  were the worst he had ever eaten in his entire life  they were from a box and Watered-down, horrible mashed potatoes. Everything that came out of the kitchen on Mother's day was awful. I do not  recommend going to The Fog Harbor Fish House for any special occasion or hoilday because they cannot get it right. When addressing the manager for all the issues that we had with our dinner. He told us word-for-word ""never come to the Fog Harbor Fish House on Mother's Day because it is the worst day of the year for them."" Who knew that, perhaps that is why they did not take it reservation. The Fog Harbor Fish House used to be a great place to go for appetizers and drinks. But they are limited on their drinks as well they only serve one type of vodka and did not serve Ciroc. My mother's Margarita came in a short heavy brandy glass--a Very short Stout heavy glass. She thought to send it back but didn't mention it until after we left the restaurant which was awful. Because that drink would have been sent back to the bar and put it in the appropriate margarita glass come especially for serving a lady. The Fog Harbor Fish House is not what it used to be, and if I'd known the service was going to be this bad I would have never taken my mother there for Mother's Day. Not only was the food awful and prepared badly but the waiter managed to waste water on two of Our Guest backs. He was the worst of them all serving our table and didn't know what to do. I was told by the manager that he had been waiting tables for 20 years. I find it very hard to believe! I had never had him wait on my table before as I have stated I have been to the Fog Harbor Fish House before and my dining experience was okay. I won't say excellent because they had some issues before but they were minor. We will not be coming back.

1315,Emie S.,"Just walking by and found this place. Our party of 7 was quickly seated in the back by the window. We had a really good view! 

We shared the calamari and everyone got the clam chowder. I got the soup/ caesar salad combo with added chicken to my salad. Surprisingly, the food came out really quickly, I didn't even get a chance to butter my bread and eat it! 

The calamari was really good and the tartar sauce was creamy and delicious. The caesar could of used more dressing but it was still good. The clam
chowder came in a bread bowl and was really delicious. The sign said it was a SF top 10 restaurant and popular specifically for their clam
chowder. I would have preferred it to be a little chunkier but overall really good.

Good place with great views! Will definitely stop by next time I'm back in SF.

For just the entree, it was $29. I'm not sure if they have a separate dinner menu, but I thought that price was steep for lunch. Definitely worth a stop if you want to splurge though. You won't be disappointed!

1321,Kyle B.,"Average sea food restaurant!!!
After reading a few of the rave reviews I was hoping to be the next critic to sing their praises, but in my honest opinion, it was just an average dining experience. Fog Harbor is your typical sea food joint with all the usual cuisine reinforced by sublime views of the bay and Wharf below. 

Upon arrival I was seated fairly quickly (considering it was Mother's Day and very crowded) at the bar, of course, which I'm used to since I typically dine alone. My meal consisted of battered fried cod filets and three, maybe four decent, but certainly not jumbo sized shrimp---as I was expecting, a side of coleslaw and fries. The fish and shrimp tasted fine; nothing spectacular, coleslaw was bland. I prefer mine creamy and sweet. Maybe it's the Floridian in me, lol. On a positive note, the vignette wine soda is definitely worth a try, for non drinkers who want to put on a spin on things. It's like drinking Chardonnay without feeling the buzz. I will say that the staff was friendly and accommodating, although, the guy who was waiting on me did disappear for awhile, but they were super busy, so it's understandable. 

In summation, Fog harbor is a classic sea food joint, safe and reassuring, but nothing outstanding. The local Red Lobster, in my opinion would meet the same expectations for slightly lesser the price.

1324,Kristie W.,"A lot of waiting for little payoff.   We visited during our layover from Hawaii to Atlanta, looking forward to some of that famous San Francisco seafood.  This restaurant was my choice and I chose poorly. 

One bright spot- the super nice hostess seated us at a terrific table overlooking the water. There are some gorgeous views to be had here so make sure you get a good table. 

Though not very crowded there was a long wait for everything.  A long wait to order drinks, to get drinks, to order food, to get food, to get check and on and on.  We almost had to go wander around and find our server to even pay our bill. Our server had a habit of stopping for long chats are many tables in her section.

The food was disappointing as well. We ordered a combo that had salmon and cod.  I don't normally care for cod (my husband does and we were splitting) so I was planning to eat the salmon.  It was so bad though!  The cod was perfect, with a very nice sauce.  The salmon was super-fishy and drowning in sauce. 

Not a horrible place but not a place we'd return to when there are so very many options in the area.

CUSTOMER SERVICE: 5/5. AJ was our main server but the manager I believe and other servers were helping us out as well. Drinks were never empty and we always got more bread when we asked. Orders were taken at a timely manner and it only took about 15 minutes for all of our food to come out.

FOOD:
SOUP/SALAD COMBO: 5/5. Got the clam chowder bread bowl and Caesar salad. So good! I loved the salad dressing and the lettuce was very fresh and crispy. They leave the lettuce strips uncut so just a heads up. I honestly didn't think too much of it but it could be a little difficult to eat.

FISH N CHIPS: 5/5. So crispy and big. The fish was delicious and the fries were great as well. Coleslaw could've been a bigger portion but not complaining. Came with about 3 big pieces! Definitely would get again.

SEAFOOD PENNE: 5/5. Really creamy and lots of seafood. Portion for this was big and definitely filling. Pasta was cooked well. Nothing wrong with this dish. Highly recommend.

OVERALL: 5/5. With views of the Pier from pretty much wherever you're sitting, great food and how classy the restaurant was, it could easily be a restaurant for a date night or a casual dinner. Can't wait to come back when in SF~

This place is a bit pricey but you do get what you pay for. The seafood is excellent and while it is a slightly more upscale place, there were many people there who were not dressed up so we fit right in. I got an Irish Coffee (it was St. Patrick's Day, after all) and the fish and chips, which I hadn't had in ages. Everything was cooked perfectly, not too oily and just the right amount of crispy. The portion was pretty big so couldn't finish it but it was delicious. Service and atmosphere were great.

1340,Robert M.,"This place is SERIOUS about food. I thought it was in the middle of the touristy part of the Fisherman's Wharf and I would pay for the scenery rather than the food. Boy I was wrong. It had both!

Almost all of the seats had spectacular views of the wharves, piers, boats and bay. Ours was not on the window, but one off the row which was in fact better. The wait service was impeccable. 

We came early which is about the smartest thing you could do if you don't want to wait for a hugely popular place to get a seat. Starters was the best old fashioned I've had. I don't like them ""muddled"", but the mashed fruit with the maple syrup was quite unique and quite enjoyable.

I started with a cub of clam chowder. It was very, very good. Not the best, but enjoyable. Lots of clams and bacon. Maybe too much bacon, but I will never say such a sacrilege out loud - ""too much bacon"". Just rip my tongue out before that happens. 

We split an appetizer portion of their scallops. They were fried in almost a Callabash style. No, I can't describe it, so Google it. I worked at a seafood restaurant on the South Carolina coast and this tasted like that. Very well cooked and very tasty. Lots of them almost like lightly battered popcorn shrimp. 

I like sampling things, so I went with the mixed grill. Had a little bit of everything. The asparagus was spot on. I'm not a tomato fan, but they were ok. The mashed potatoes were wonderful. Not mashed enough to be smooth, so it had a great texture and taste. It came with three of the most AWESOME grilled shrimp that I hoped I would come back some day just for the shrimp. It also came with a  fabulous piece of salmon. That too would have made a great meal. Finally a piece very superb swordfish. I started going into mental overload thinking which I would have as a dedicated meal if I ever came back. Too many awesome choices!

1347,Kelsey S.,"We were hard-pressed to find a restaurant that met everyone's needs: my mom wanted seafood, my dad is a picky eater and seemingly only eats red meat, and we didn't want to spend a fortune. The only place I could find with two dollar signs that served both seafood and steak was the Fog Harbor Fish House. They were concerned about it being too touristy, and were also put off by the fact that we couldn't get a reservation, but I wanted to give it a chance.

Well. Sure, it's at Pier 39, but it's not ""touristy"" in the typical sense. It's elegant, and very San Francisco. It has a wonderful view of the bay, and our window faced the lovely sunset over Mt. Tam.

They really do reserve most of their tables for walk-ins; we were nervous about walking up at 6 p.m. without a reservation, but we only had to wait 15 minutes.

The food was exquisite. I had the seafood penne, which was to die for. The mussels are HUGE! Others had the mixed grill, the seafood platter, and the Fog Harbor burger. Everyone loved their meals, and our waitress, Ashley, was very kind and attentive.

As for the price, it's a bit more than two dollar signs. But graded on a curve, I'd say that it is less expensive than other places that serve similar fare. Each dish could have easily cost $5-10 more elsewhere.

This would be a lovely place to bring visitors from out of town or a local date just the same.

Instead we received great food and excellent service. It was the perfect lunch experience and our server Ashlee was amazing adding to our overall experience!

Okay so really the clam chowder is awesome! Recommended by my family who live in the city over Boudin's. Good call sister because I was out on a date. The view is incredible as you sit there with the bay view of the ""ROCK"" and ships coming into and out of port. World class service makes you feel like you are at a fine dining restaurant. Yet this place is adorned by locals as well and affordable. The menu suits all and I will make sure to come back.

The calamari was excellently cooked with fried jalepanos and onions alongside a lemon aioli sauce. The fish and chips portion was large enough to be shared by two people and it came out perfect. I don't know if I've ever had better. You can actually tell they change the grease out of the fryer because instead of tasting grease you tasted the breaded goodness and the fish.

Please don't be afraid to eat here since it is literally on the world famous Pier 39. It will be worth the wait as everyone and everything we encountered here was a positive and memorable experience! Looking forward to coming back soon!

Before we finished our crab cocktail, our main courses were ready and it was just amazing. I highly highly recommend going here. Definitely worth the price.

1358,Maura W.,"We knew going in that this would be kind of a tourist trap, but the menu, reviews, and proximity to the Alcatraz dock drew us in. The food was actually quite good, as were the drinks, and our waiter was very nice. Unfortunately, our service was extremely rushed. We placed our order - for adults an app, soup, and entree all to share - and our waiter asked if we wanted it all at once. I said please no, we'd like our appetizer first for sure and the rest could come when it was ready. Instead, all of our food hit at once, less than 10 min after we ordered. Very disappointing, as our app was fried calamari. Didn't want to neglect the Dungeness crab, but I also don't care for fried food once it gets cold. The restaurant was not full, so we would have appreciated appropriately paced service. Especially since we specifically requested it.

Reply to comment - it was last Monday for a late lunch. We probably sat down between 1:30 and 2. Everything else was good, but we wouldn't have ordered the app if it was going to come out like that.

1363,Tiffany D.,"Fog Harbor Fish House was the first place my husband and I ate when we arrived in San Fran. It was a late lunch and dinner basically. We decided to tour Pier 39 first and when we got here we were starving. It was the first place we came across that looked descent so we decided to dine here. The menu looked nice as well as the restaurant itself. We liked that you could view the Bay while eating. We were greeted by the hostess and had no wait. Our waiter was nice and asked us if we had any questions about the menu. Overall the staff was very nice and welcoming.

We first started with drinks. I ordered the Strawberry-Basil Nojito and he ordered the Maple Old Fashion. My drink was non-alcoholic. It was very good and fizzy and had the perfect blend of strawberry, mint and basil. Nothing was overpowering. Very good. My husband's drink was strong and he enjoyed it. Old Fashions are way to strong for me. 

Next we started with appetizers, side salads and bread. We decided to split a Calm Chowder Bread Bowl and we both ordered our own side salad. I ordered a Mix Green Salad and he ordered a Caesar Salad. I'm not a big fan of Clam Chowder but I'm willing to try most things. I honestly don't care for soup but Clam Chowder is just to creamy and weird for me. My husband was more so wanting to try this and being a team player I did. Now our salads were amazing. Yes they were simple but very good. My mixed Green Salad had the standard Balsamic Dressing but this dressing was thicker and a dark orange color. Very tasty. I didn't taste my husband's salad but he did mention that his salad was one of the best Caesars he has had in awhile so I take it that it was good. Lol. He's the one to order all the fattening (don't worry he works out and is skinny) stuff when we go out and I'm the one to make sure we get our greens. We ate all of this with their standard Sourdough Bread. It wasn't anything special, basic Sourdough. 

For our lunch/dinner I ordered the Pacific Sole and he ordered the Lobster Tail. My dinner came with a Spinach and Red Pepper mix with Fingerling Potatoes. My husband's meal came with Mashed Potatoes and Steamed Broccoli. My dish was AMAZING!! The fish was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The butter sauce was amazing as well and probably one of the better ones I have tasted. I personally don't liked sautéed spinach so this part wasn't my favorite. The only cooked spinach I like is creamed spinach. The red peppers added a nice touch to the fish. My only complaint about the dish is that the Potatoes could have used more seasoning or could have been crisped or something. They were just plain and put on the plate. I'm sure they were roasted but there was no crispness about them or flavor at all. My husband liked his Lobster Tail. I didn't try his lobster as I don't like the texture of lobster, but I did try his Mashed Potatoes. They were definitely a lot better than my potatoes and good. 

Overall, the Fog Harbor Fish House was a good place to eat. Decently priced food and drinks that are good.

1364,D Z.,"This is a great restaurant in the tourist pier 39 area,  food was excellent and reasonably priced for the upscale nature of the place.  I got the clam chowder and it was above average as well as the entree.  As stated earlier, this is a tourist centered area, so don't expect any unique local flavors to the area.  It's a good place to take the fam if you are in the area, but not really a destination to seek out for a SF culinary experience.

Whole steamed fresh dungenous crab with a side of al dente steamed broccoli and liquid butter, and soy ginger glazed wasabi aioli seared ahi over a bed of fragrant garlic sautéed Jasmine rice. We ended our lunch with the dessert duo of mini vanilla bean creme brûlée and chococlate infused dense rich mini lava cake coupled with fresh whipped cream and a stroke of real strawberry puree. Talk about gastronomical delights! Did I mention the fantastic view of Pier 39? Pure heaven!!

We ordered several entrees to tryout and I would say clam chowder was the best. Calamari was somewhat okay nothing special, oysters as well, I tried better oysters at other location.

1372,Cristal J.,"We came 1-1-18 at about 630ish. We waited for about 20-30 min to be called on. Which isn't too bad. I don't like that we couldn't make reservations. But that's ok. The timing wasn't too bad. 
When we got seated our server what it seemed like didn't know a lot of English maybe? He didn't really communicate with us well. For example. I know we were suppose to get a bread bowl with butter and we didn't get it after we got our appetizer. The bread felt and smelled fresh so I'm assuming they had to put a loaf in. But our server should've of communicate that with us. 
The appetizers was very good. I order the crab ceviche. Not enough chips to eat it though. My friend got fried scallops and those were very good. 
I ordered the clam chowder bread bowl with extra crab and wow! Delicious which is why I'm giving the restaurant 3 stars. Because the food was very well cooked. 
When we would get refills only one of us got a refill per visit. And we would tell our sever who needed a refill but idk if he just can't multi task. Not sure. When we got a bread bowl refill we weren't given more butter.
The sever could probably use more training . But other than that it was a nice experience.

1374,Ricky L.,"Don't eat here this is a tourist trap, the view was great I loved it sat down, I ordered the whole garlic butter crab along with the add on garlic noodles. When the food came out they mixed the noodles all in with the crab as if a kid mixed his food together, you would think the grab and noodles would come separate but whatever no biggie I separated myself so the grab cake out very very dry with nothing under the head so basically just a decoration which you would think you would get something under there for the price you pay again whatever. The server then informed me hat she loves that dish so I tried a small portion of the noodles and flagged the waiter and told her it was bland it had no flavor so she I didn't have to pay. Moments later I tried the crab a small piece of leg and same result so I then flagged the server again and told her I had the same issue with the crab so she said she'll take it all back and get a menu so that I can pick something else, but when she left I got up grabbed my stuff and got out of there. I'm so surprised this place have 4 stars people taste buds are not properly coordinated or they're lying trust me avoid this place by all means you'll be happy you took my advice.

The clams were not smooth and juicy and they looked like burnt popcorn. My wife's fish and chips? A disappointment. She almost returned her fish. Of the 3 pcs you get she only ate one. The other two had a very doubtful dark grey color and so bad you could not separate the meat from the batter. As if it were one of the same. Gross. Very disappointed and sad for it was my decision to bring my family there and this place let me down. Will not recommend it to anyone.

I came today, Saturday probably the busiest day for them I'm guessing. I did not make a reservation For our group but I don't ever mind having a drinks with the bar first and then heading to a table, usually takes less thank 30. This staff is run around though! You can see how bustling it is when your waiting!!! We sat by a window this time which is always nice! The server we had today is hands down the best server I've had since coming here!!! Even though she was SO SO busy!! A lot of tables here don't speak English and they accommodate that well with photos (I bring clients here a lot in the day) however it can busy with everyone waving down your server. Our server Shawna was amazing! Girl never broke a smile the whole time!! Although I had been there my table guests had not so she went though the whole menu and how it's best to work it. We shared family style and everyone was impressed with every single thing!! Shawna had amazing attention to detail, always knew when we needed water, extra sauces, etc, also although it was so busy we didn't feel rushed at all! AMAZING SERVICE!!!

The wait for our table took around 45 minutes which I think is pretty fair considering the restaurant's busy location. There are plenty of benches and chairs to sit and wait at which is awesome for my tired feet. My boyfriend and I were seated on the right side of the restaurant with a nice view of Alcatraz and the water. Lulu was our server who was very helpful in guiding us on what her recommendations were on the menu. We had the mussel fries as our appetizer, my boyfriend had the cioppino and I had the seared scallops with parmesan crab risotto. Lulu and the rest of the staff checked on our table often which was so nice. All of the dishes were packed with flavor! We were too full for dessert so we omitted from ordering but I mentioned that it was my boyfriend's birthday yesterday and Lulu brought him a delicious creme brûlée! We could not have been any more happier with our experience at the Fog Harbor Fish House. I recommend coming here with your significant other, family and friends and I hope you have Lulu as your server!

1388,Jenny C.,"We were enjoying the day at Pier 39 and wanted a nice lunch spot away that was a little quieter. First off, this place really does have the best view of the water. We were seated at a table right in front of the window and we could enjoy watching the hustle and bustle down below. The view is what is bumping up the rating of this place from a 3 star to a 4 star place because the service and food is average. Warm sourdough bread is complementary! I love restaurants that still offer bread service. This is a surprise these days with most places making you pay for bread and butter. 

We ordered the clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl, the crab salad sandwich and half a dozen oysters. The oysters were fresh but the typical common variety so nothing special. The clam chowder actually had bits of clam in it and went really well with the bread. But next time I would just order the clam chowder without the bread bowl and save $2. They serve fresh sourdough for free which I found out after ordering. The filling in the crab salad was good as well but the fries left much to be desired. I wish they had the option of a salad or veggies with the sandwich because there's already a lot of bread so its certainly not a balanced meal.

Service was subpar. She was rushed, unfriendly and unable to answer my question when I asked her what variety of oysters were being served.

1394,Sean C.,"At famous Pier 39 on the upper deck, it very much delivers on upscale seafood preparation with certain niche offerings (Salmon BLT, anyone? Crab Sandwich that's shredded crab, how 'bout that?). Their chowder bowls are incredible. World class wine and beer selection to pair up with, I dunno, anything. The waiting area is nice. The glass views of the bay are nice, if not, marvelous. The drawback is that it's crowded for a reason, but that doesn't mean you can't find a great table on a late afternoon, a Thursday or a rainy day. Sophisticated eating at Pier 39?

1395,Mandy T.,"Tourist trap, as expected. On the 2nd level of Pier 39 complex, hubby was getting hangry and refused to walk anywhere else for food. We settled in here as they had good reviews, has a view over the sea lions beaching at the pier, the interior looked clean and well put together, and they offered crayons and coloring sheets to entertain the little one. 

Started off promising. The waitstaff were all professional. We got complimentary blue cheese garlic bread using one of the coupons in the Pier 39 Fun Pack. The appetizer was huge!  It tasted alright.  But our entrees did not fair well. We got the Fried Combo that was basically fish and chips with fried shrimp and calamari - since we were by the pier, we thought this would be a safe bet to get good seafood. It wasn't. The batter on the fish wasn't crispy enough and the entire dish lacked seasoning.  For $23, it was not memorable and overpriced.  I was craving a burger so we also got the Fog Harbor Burger - sounded good on paper but the burger itself was actually quite dry and hard to swallow. Taste-wise, it was bland (no memorable sauce to improve the taste) and rather boring. A very basic burger for $15. 

So overall, overpriced and unmemorable food serving mostly tourists, but does provide a view, comfortable seating and good service.

I had ordered an entree from the Spring Special. Curtiss's recommendations convinced us to engage on our opportunity to opt for crab dishes since they were in season.  
My boyfriend ordered the Halibut, and let me tell you-- the flavors melted into your mouth.  It Paired very well with the arugula salad topped balsamic vinegar. The dressing added a crisp cut of flavor.
I ordered the scallops with the crab and garlic risotto. Comforting flavors that provide for a hearty meal. I LOVED IT.  I'm not an avid seafood eater, but after eating this dish has left me wanting to explore the depths of seafood cuisine.

1404,Hai L.,"It's hard deciding on a place to eat when you're at pier 39. There are so many opportunities and places to check out. After a lot of searching, decided to check out this place based on a large amount of positive reviews. This is an institution that serves fresh seafood and gives off a scenic view of the Pier. The dining experience and views of the Bay Area and Golden Gate Bridge attracts visitors and tourists to visit this restaurant at least once. There appeared to be a half hour wait due to how busy it was. Not a problem. The wait seemed to go by immediately and suddenly we were already inside the restaurant. Fog harbor is said to serve 100% sustainable seafood which could be a bias to anyone who hasn't tried it. The menu offers a great selection of food. Customers get to enjoy complimentary sourdough bread that is baked in house. To start off with the appetizer, we decided to go with a dozen baked oysters that consists of spinach, bacon, and creamy Parmesan sauce. These oysters were incredible. It felt like they popped right in your mouth and had so much flavor. I decided to also get the award winning clam chowder bread bowl! This was amazing as well. For the entree, I decided to go with the mixed grill platter that is made with grilled salmon, pacific cod, and shrimp, citrus beurre blanc, sautéed vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes. Food was prepared instantly and did not take long to bring out. The waiter was really friendly but did not bring out water drinks immediately to begin with. Had to give him a reminder. No problem. For a beverage, I also went with the 8 oz flint and steel Sauvignon that was recommended by the waiter. This wine pairs well with fish and had a stronger taste. I would give this restaurant 5 stars based on the food. Price is a bit on the more expensive side but you get what you pay for. Amazing views depending on where you are seated along with fresh seafood right near the pier. Definitely would go again!

Ordered the summer special: scallop risotto, shelllfish platter made with garlic herb butter sauce w/ add on lobster tail, and their famous clam chowder w/ crab add-on.

4 of 5: Great food, regret the lobster tail, and clam chowder should only be ordered with the crab addon! To die for! 

You can feel your blood pressure rising from the taste of fresh ocean.

Update: Yes I'll be back. It was good enough to go back. I recently went to Sotto Mare and based on reviews was expecting it to be really good but it wasn't - it was huge but not good and was missing clams and mussels :(. Fog Harbor definitely better.

1408,T. M.,"The View is indeed spectacular. We had a great view of the sunset while waiting for our meal to come for 2 hours. Our waiter ruined the experience for us. We sat down and placed our order around 6pm. Got our soup and salad 15 minutes later. Waited another hour, still no sign of our entrees. The waiter comes back one time and says the entrees are on the way. Another 20 mins later, he decides to really check to see whats taking so long only to realize that he did not place the order for us correctly in the system. So waited another 30 mins for them to cook our entrees. Customers that came in after us ate and left while we are still waiting for our meal. Shame on our waiter for not noticing that we were waiting this long and not checking in on us. And the only thing we got out of it is a free desert! Our time is valuable because we are on vacation and should not have been wasted like this.

I ordered the Grilled shrimp brochette which came plated beautifully with tasty sautéed spinach, roasted butternut squash, garlic mashed potatoes, and garlic butter. The dish was flavorful, healthy, delicious and not overly filling!

The service was 5/5. Views are 5/5 and Food was 5/5. The extra San Fran taxes were surprising coming from out of state, but totally worth it!

1416,Tara M.,"Was vacationing near Fisherman's Wharf and wanted to have fish and chips for dinner. We selected Fog Harbor after looking at reviews, location, and menu. We were impressed by the view of the Bay from our table, the cleanliness of the restaurant, and the service. We started with the crab cakes with buerre blanc sauce and mango salsa. They were perfectly crispy and the mango salsa really complimented the sweet crap. Did not taste ""fishy"" at all. I ordered the shrimp and chips- came with 8 huge butterflied, panko crusted shrimp, fries, and a coleslaw with a horseradish kick. It was all very tasty and prepared well. My husband ordered the fried combo with fish, shrimp, and calamari. It all was great, crispy, fresh. Again nothing ""fishy"" tasting. We ended the meal with creme brûlée. Nothing new here- it's a popular,common dessert...but it tasted great. So many seafood restaurants in this area to choose from but this one was one of the better ones.

S E R V I C E 
We were immediately sat down when we walked up to the podium. I can't recall if my server had mentioned her name or not. The service was pretty good I have to say. They were really attentive and patient with me when I couldn't decide what I want to eat yet. 

They validate parking garage tickets for an hour :) that's $9 !! Hehe. 


F O O D ! ! 

Clam chowder (5/5) 
I have read some of the reviews and people say the clam chowder is the best. It was Good but I can't say it's the best I ever had. I honestly haven't tasted THE best yet. So I'm still looking. However, this one IS pretty good. Some places are very stingy with their clams. Not here though. They gave a pretty decent amount of clams in their soup. I'd still give it a 5/5 :) cause it was good. Not too salty , which is great.

Baked Oysters (5/5) 
The best baked oysters I've had in a LONG time ! That cheese ricotta-like on the oyster was so yummy. I'm not sure what kind of cheese they used but I'm guessing it's ricotta . I didn't read the menu for it lol. I just saw baked oysters and I had to try It. They're small oysters, so it's super yummy hehe. I recommend trying it. 

Seared Tuna- 2/5 
This entre was too salty. Not the tuna, but the veggies and the sauce it was cooked in was too salty and very overwhelminThe garlic mash potato was pretty average. The fish was okay too. I wasn't a really big fan of this dish, so I was kinda disappointed.

1425,Jack R.,"I feel rich. Like lottery winning rich.

I won a $100 gift certificate here, and I went all out when it came to ordering food.

But don't worry, I'm not that selfish. I like to share the wealth, so I invited my friends and paid the difference.

Here's what we had and our thoughts.

Clam chowder: Great, creamy, clam-y. Everyone loved their clam chowder. The ones with the bread bowl loved the bread too.

Caesar salad: Huge portion, good dressing, not overly great, just okay.

Baked oysters: These tasted a bit raw even though they were supposed to be baked. Even the cheese on top was cold. But this is where the service shined. Our waiter was always checking up on us, and we even had service from the District Manager Neusom, who came over and checked on us as well. When we told him about the oysters, he struck it from the bill immediately.

Large Shrimp Cocktail: Delicious, and lived up to it's name. They were large. So good we couldn't stop ordering and eating these. 

Crab cakes: Excellent flavor. More crab meat than breading, great texture. We ordered several of them because we liked them so much.

Chippino: Huge,and filled with things you would find under the sea. Clams, crab, salmon, I mean this thing was a cauldron of goodness.

I want to say that our waiter was exceptional and was always there to fill up water, and even bagged up fresh sourdough for one of my friends who wanted to take some bread home.

Being that this is a tourist spot, I highly recommend it for tourists who may be overwhelmed with all the choices on the Pier.

Even as a local, I can say, I'll definitely be back.

They offer an extensive wine selection, and the cocktails are pretty impressive as well (Moscow Mule with extra lime).

1430,Kelvin L.,"Wish I could give this place a zero star.

1) Got here with a reservation, ended up waiting an additional 15 minutes which is the least of my complaints 

2) Asked the waiter if the oysters were good on that night, he said they were ""very good"". To keep it short and simple, the oysters we're not prepared well. Salty like it was never rinsed or cleaned out. Oysters were TINY. No flavor other than sea water. Not good to the pallet. Had small shell bits inside. 

3) Ordered a $7.50 non alcoholic berry drink. You would think they would put a little more effort for that price point. Basically a flat Sprite with some dried blackberries. I'd much rather drink a can of sprite had I known any better.

4) Asked the waiter for parking validation. He said be right back with it and came back with the bill - no validation. I ended up having to ask another and he got for me just before I got up to leave. My original waiter comes back and drops a second validation on my table and walks off as he probably saw my 12% tip ( which I felt thoroughly justified for the lack of presence and honesty about the food).

5) Here's the kicker. CHECK YOUR BANK STATEMENTS. I clearly wrote $130 on the $117 tab, giving them a $13 tip which I was even reluctant to give in the first place. What do they do? Charge me $140. This is theft. I clearly, in big and clear numbers wrote $130. And no, this is not about $10. It's about the integrity of this restaurant. So naturally, I called in, and the host said he would check and call me back right away. No call. I called in 6 hours later, same host picked up. Explained to him the situation once again, he put me on hold, and then hung up on me. Never called me back again. This place is a sham. Check your bank statements. Especially if you tip them less that the 18%, they will pull a fast one. I'm sure I'm not the first and definitely won't be the last. Contacted my bank and will file a dispute.

1434,Danae L.,"Bf and I came around 7pm and were seated towards the entrance right away. It was really windy so asked to be seated towards the inside. The host immediately told us there's a wait to sit inside. Well shouldn't you have given us the option of waiting to sit inside? The estimated waiting time for the Inside was 10 minutes, but we were seated in less than 2.

We shared the shellfish platter, chicken penne, and calamari.

I really enjoyed the calamari! It wasn't oily compared to other restaurants and had a nice crunch.

The chicken from the pasta was slightly plain and dry.

The shellfish putter comes with half a dozen of oysters, 0.5lb of crab, half a pound of lobsters, and shrimp. Average quality. My one complaint is they didn't offer sauce that wasn't spicy. Oysters were a bit small.

Overall they exceed my expectations given that I wasn't preparing myself for a five-star treatment. What I come again? Maybe next year.

Our orders seemed to come out wrong a couple times -- or our server was just jotting down the wrong order. We received only half a dozen oysters when we had asked for a dozen.. and were given our clam chowder in a bowl when I had asked for a bread bowl. All fixable mistakes, however, so no real harm done. The ambiance indoors is rather nice though, for anywhere else to dine at in the area. It's not too ""touristy"" seeming, and there's a lovely view if you are lucky enough to dine by the window.

1443,Joy W.,"From afar, Fog Harbor Fish House always looked like any other Pier 39 seafood restaurant to me. Upon closer inspection, it's actually very nice. The waiting area outside is a tiled patio with couches, a fireplace, and a painting above the fireplace, so it feels more like a cozy outdoor living room. 
They take reservations on Opentable, which is probably a good idea for a tourist-heavy location.
The menu includes a variety of seafood dishes and quite a few fried items. For a seafood restaurant, there is a good amount of land dishes for those who don't eat seafood. We had a cozy table by the window and enjoyed the waterfront view during dinner.

Crispy Bay Scallops ($13) - panko breaded & fried, w/ roasted jalapeno aioli:
I was hoping the scallops would have a light crunchy panko crust, but the tiny bite-sized bay scallops were completely coated in breading and unrecognizable as scallops. It was my mistake. I should have guessed panko breaded meant covered in panko. It was too much breading and a little too oily for me to enjoy them as scallops. If I knew they would have that much breading, I wouldn't have ordered this dish. It's not bad for a deep-fried snack. The thick, heavy jalapeno aioli added a little bit of a kick.

Shellfish Platter ($38 for 1, $59 for 2) - 1/2 crab, mussels, clams, shrimp, oven roasted w/ butter, garlic, herbs:
The shellfish massacre presented in front of us was seasoned nicely and tasted quite fresh. The crab legs were sweet and meaty. The mussels and clams were nice and springy. The shrimp at the bottom of the plate soaked up all the buttery juices and herbs. It also came with some corn on the cob and garlic toast. 

Bread Pudding ($8.50) - topped w/ vanilla ice cream, vanilla bean sauce, dusted with cocoa powder:
Dinner was a little salty, so I wanted something sweet. I'm fond of bread pudding, so that was an easy choice. It was served warm and gooey and the edges were a little crispy.

While we ate, we enjoyed watching the sunset over the water. It made for a nice meal. If I come back, I'd probably try the cioppino next.

Fog Harbor Fish House is conveniently located right in the front of Pier 39 on the second floor above a souvenir shop. The place itself is very upscale looking on the inside and I know I felt a bit underdressed walking in. But who cares, it's located in the heart of a touristy area.

We were seated for a party of 4 right away. We had an awesome view of the water. Our waiter was a gentleman name Tyler who went above and beyond his job description. Very cool dude.

We ordered: clam chowder, calamari, fish and chips, and jumbo shrimp cocktail.

Everything we had was exceptional. There was not one thing that we ordered that my friends and I didn't enjoy. I wish we had room for dessert!

We tried their clam chowder bread bowl. I say we but it was really my friend. I had a spoonful of the chowder and thought it was pretty basic but good. I think I just personally prefer a creamier chowder. The waitress did say that it was the clam chowder bowl WITH the topping of crab that was the award winner, which makes sense. Who doesn't like crab on top of anything? 

I ordered their Ciopinno and I was pleasantly surprised. They didn't skimp on the seafood. The bowl was filled with different times of seafood, shrimp, scallops, fish, crab, etc. It was hearty and the broth was delicious. They also included some garlic bread to dip into it.

We started with alcoholic beverages which were decent, but didn't taste like much alcohol was in them. We ordered appetizers of Calamari and Clam Chowder which was quite delicious. No complaints there. However, our entrees came out and that's when our experience took a nosedive. The table ordered the recommended dishes such as the Seafood Penne and the Fish and Chips. The battered fish was bland and tasteless, and the Seafood Penne Pasta left more to be desired. The sauce was so thin it slid right off the pasta leaving a plain noodle. The service was awful, and I'm pretty sure the server was high the entire time. I expected a lot more from a nicer restaurant and wish we had chosen a different place.

1460,Jocelyn P.,"Things I liked about our visit to this place last Friday. 
1.  The ambiance -- it was nice. We were seated on the upper level. We had a beautiful view of the bay. 
2.  The food -- I had the combination platter (1/2 crab, shrimp, mussels and clams).  It was delicious! It was cooked well. Very flavorful. My husband had the crab cocktail. The kids had something from the kids' menu. Lol
3.  The server -- Mel was very friendly. Accommodated our requests. We had our 3 kids with us. He was patient and kind.  Very knowledgeable. 

We will definitely come back again!

1461,H. Bill R.,"All of my followers know I love good food. I'm a bit of a foodie. While visiting in San Francisco, my wife and I had a yearning for some great seafood. San Francisco is noted for its great seafood restaurants. We were not disappointed at all. The Dungeoness crab with garlic was awesome. This has to be the best clam chowder I have ever had; not too salty, just simply fantastic. Their clam chowder had no grains of sand in it. It was perfectly prepared. Simply amazing, and it is an award-winning restaurant. Enough said, I highly recommend this place.

1464,LauraMay N.,"I was a bit worried since some people said this place was a tourist trap on here, but it turned out to be wonderful! 

The boy and I came here for an anniversary dinner since we were craving seafood. We made a reservation a few days in advance, hoping and requesting a nice seat. We came 20 minutes early, and we were seated just in time! Next to a window with a view of the bay too! Someone had also wrote ""Happy Anniversary!"" on our table. :) 

For starters, we ordered the clam chowder and fried scallops. I ordered the shellfish platter for one with a lobster tail for my entree, and the boy ordered the surf and turf. Everything was perfect! You could tell the seafood was fresh and the boy was also happy with the quality and cooking of the steak. We loved everything that we ordered, and also enjoyed a yummy creme brûlée. 

We were in awe of the meal we had. Not to mention, the sour dough was the best we ever had! We couldn't stop raving about it. We also have to thank our server Justin H. for being so awesome and kind. We asked to take our leftover bread to go, and he came back with more fresh sour dough to take home!

1469,Sheila C.,"I loved the ambiance of the restaurant! Although there was a really loud group of Asians sitting right beside us, it didn't stop me from enjoying the food and the view of the bay! We ordered salmon and surf & turf. The salmon was bomb, flavour was on point! The steak, on the other hand, was a little too hard for me. It was hard to chew. The lobster looked great but it was a tad bit too salty for me. The best part of the entire meal was the clam chowder! It was bomb, definitely need to give it a try! Worth the money.

1475,Jeanne T.,"Sometimes you gotta' go full tourist.  I'm giving this restaurant five stars not because it's the best restaurant in San Francisco but because it's the best place of its type.  When you want to visit the pier, relax and enjoy the view while drinking a local beer, this is the spot.  

I've dined at the Fog Harbor twice and enjoyed both meals immensely.  My last visit I was solo on a beautiful day.  I sat at the bar and enjoyed an Anchor Steam and a crab roll sandwich while Tony took great care of me.  

Is Fog Harbor touristy and overpriced?  Yes, but you get what you pay for.  A wonderful view, lovely service and very good food.  I would not hesitate to recommend Fog Harbor to anyone looking to have a nice meal in the area.  

Enjoy!

1477,Lavette K.,"We are not tourist. We live here and are not easily impressed. This lovely place is even better if you choose to sit in the tables that seat 4 in the back of the restaurant. Your view is perfect position of Alcatraz  with the Golden Gate bridge just behind and the gorgeous skyline on your left and sea lions just below on your right. 
Start the night with server Jane who can recommend  the perfect wine pairing for your meal. At $22.00 per glass the chardonnay should taste live Heaven and it did. It was the perfect companion to the mixed grill and the shell fish platter with lobster tail add on.
Do also try the appetizer, their perfect Jumbo Shrimp paired with the award winning hibiscus margarita and take your time with them. This view and these tastes are meant to be savored with warm conversation and your lover. We closed the delightful evening with the tiramisu  and warm apple crisp. Pure joy! Thank you Jane for the recommendations! Superb food and service!

But I decided to try it out anyway.  Ordered the seafood platter - steamed crab, mussels, shrimp, clams, added a lobster tail with fingerling potatoes in butter garlic sauce.  Simply amazing.

1484,Jennie N.,"I usually void Fisherman's wharf especially around the holidays--getting run over by strollers and pedestrians just ain't my thang; but I was in a rather cheery mood and decided to take in the Christmas decorations before they get torn down. 
We decided to have dinner at Fog Harbor Fish House (thanks to Yelp reviews) and they did not disappoint. 
For starters, we had the calamari, red chili garlic shrimp and mussel fries. All were quite tasty, particularly the garlic shrimp. That sauce had the right amount of spice and kick. 
We followed with their award winning clam chowder in a bread bowl--thick and creamy with plenty of clam chunks. Just YUMS!
For the main course, we ordered the cioppino, ahi tuna and seafood penne. My little tot had the chicken tenders. All are highly recommended including the tenders--very meaty and well...tender.
Everything was great but what really brought this review from a 4 star experience to 5 is our waiter, Justin. 
He was accommodating and made sure our dinner experience was an unforgettable one. 
We were all pleasantly surprised by Justin's attentiveness, how fresh the food was and our overall experience considering the restaurant is in a tourist trap. 
If you're in the area and don't mind the wait and the crowds, Fog Harbor is worth the visit.

We also had clam chowder in a bread bowl (of course) and seafood penne dish, both outstanding.

You don't come to Fog Harbor for something that's going to push your palate. They have a standard menu that everyone will find something they like (seafood, sandwiches, salads, ect) and everything tastes good.

It was so delicious particularly dipped in the sauce that was provided. For the main course, I ordered the Ahi Tuna, seared with a sesame seed crust, ginger soy glaze, wasabi aioli and stir fried vegetables. I had a side of rice to go along with that. 

This place is a tad pricey, but for the price you pay at almost any San Francisco restaurant, I guess it's considered pretty standard. I definitely recommend this restaurant if you are in the San Francisco area!

I came here for a large business dinner, so I was kind of stuck with whatever they had here. I get it - it's a fish house, it's not meant to cater to vegetarians, but they could at least try to have 1-2 on menu options. Instead, they only have 1 off menu pasta dish and a couple of appetizers. They can also make the salad without meat.

That said, 2 stars for excellent, friendly, service. Our waitresses and staff were very nice and the location gives you a great view of Fisherman's Wharf. If you look back towards the city, you see the skyline and have an opportunity for some great photos.

For lunch after Alcatraz, my girlfriend and I were ready to chow down and this place had us seated quickly with service soon to follow. We started off with the blue cheese garlic bread which had the perfect combo of cheese and garlic but was a little too burnt at the ends for our liking. Nothing too special about the NY strip I had; it was cooked as requested, medium rare, and had a strange unknown glaze which didn't do the dish much good. The dessert menu here is great and they have a live sample display if you ask to see it. All in all, very pricey but offered a great view of the bay and servers are very attentive!

1511,Jen R.,"Our very first night in one of my favorite cities, after the day of traveling (albeit, it was a short flight) and upon hitting the touristy Pier 39, we realized we were famished. We actually went online and the only available reservation was for 
10pm that evening which was so not 
happening so, we took a chance at just walking up and surprisingly only had a 20 minute wait.

Upon sitting down we immediately decided on the Blue Cheese garlic bread for an appetizer and a few beers to start. The bread was perfectly crispy and I was pleasantly surprised to find that they did not skimp on the delicious Point Reyes blue cheese. 

I settled on Linguine with Clams and my husband went for the Flat Iron Steak. The latter of which, I must admit, I was hesitant about given the location and abundance of wonderful seafood options. However, I was extremely happy to be wrong; the hubs claimed this to be the best steak he's ever tasted and I do believe, my dish may have been as well. Not only were the clams obviously fresh, the seasoning was perfect and the sauce, nice and light to showcase the delicious seafood. 

The service was absolutely phenomenal and the views of both Alcatraz and Golden Gate Bridge from our table absolutely could not be beat. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone either visiting or, living in San Francisco.

1513,Tar R.,"Yelp describes this best. Meh I've had better. My best friend was visiting and he really wanted to have a touristy experience in SF so we decided to come here. He remembered as a child that the clam chowder was really good, but unfortunately his memory led us astray. The clam chowder is decent, but for the price/quality, walk down the street and get some from the other vendors in the open market.

In addition, the bar is unfamiliar with signature traditional cocktails and we often had to explain how to make our own drinks which is never a good sign.

2 stars - keep your expectations managed. It's tourist trap in my opinion. It's not bad, it's just not great. It will just leave you wondering if you should of went somewhere else and if this was truly worth the money.

Bring your appetite and just take your time eating and enjoying the bread, atmosphere and food.

I always order a full crab, fresh and made to order... It's a must for every year when I visit the pier ...

1529,Stephanie K.,"The table next to us dropped their wine glass, which rolled to our table and broke into pieces when it hit our table leg. It took some time to get our host's attention, who promptly took away the large broken pieces. He said he would come back to get the other small pieces, but it turned out he meant he would wait until we left (we really misunderstood him). We waited, he didn't come back, so I asked the waiter if he could get a broom to clean up the remaining pieces. Instead, they both came back and made me feel guilty for asking them to get a broom to clean it up; they said it would be a huge ordeal to get us to stand up and get the broom, even though the table next to us - the one who'd broken the glass - was empty and they could've just moved us there. They even pointed out that since we weren't wearing flip flops, it should be no problem for us to remain as we were. It made me feel really embarrassed to ask for something that I thought was a basic courtesy (not eating with broken glass at our table's feet!). At this point my partner just told them to forget it since they seemed reluctant to do anything. So we ate the rest of our meal quickly, avoiding the broken glass. We won't be back again. I know it's no matter to Fog Harbor, since they get so much foot traffic, but it was a huge disappointment to us. We know it's really busy at the restaurant but that's no excuse to speak condescendingly to patrons or deny them a basic courtesy, like eating without broken glass at our feet. The table next to us was really apologetic and accommodating for accidentally breaking their glass, much more so than Fog Harbor ever was.

I had a window table with a great view. The Salmon was moist and seasoned perfectly the cod just fell apart the shrimp were a nice size with great taste.

I'm still working off this food coma I'm in right now because of how delicious everything was. The fried sea scallops were delicious with the jalapeño aioli. Your meal comes with a complimentary loaf of fresh sourdough, which you can dip in whatever you order. I had to try the creme brûlée at the end, but obviously needed a glass of milk to go with it. But all they had was 2%!

You could tell the bread is fresh baked and we opted to add crab meat to our bowl which made it even more amazing. The fried fish was also very good. The calamari and shrimp were also tasty. It only took about 10 minutes to be seated on a Saturday at 4:00pm which was impressive. Our server Mel was friendly and made sure everything was good with our meal.

Our server Samir was fantastic and attentive without being obtrusive. The Kendall Jackson Chardonnay was delicious. We finished the entire bottle. I wish we had more time to eat here again while we are visiting San Francisco because I'd come back. This restaurant is definitely worth a visit and in a great location!

The complimentary sourdough bread provided was perfect - just the right taste.  Award winning Clam chowder in bread bowl was rich and clamy :)
We ordered the Dungeness Crab cakes - they just melt in your mouth - exquisite flavors. Must recommended. Lobster tail - Presentation of this dish was very creative and it tasted soft and succulent. Fish and chips was not so great. Desserts was Vanilla Bean Creme Brûlée. Its freaking awesome...must try.

1541,David R.,"My wife and I were in SF during Christmas weekend having just finished a late afternoon bay tour and needed something to warm us back up. The crowds were decent and we expected long waits regardless of where we decided to dine so we settled on splurging a little. We put our names on the wait list and after hearing the party before us (party of 4) get a 45 minute wait time we were estatic that our names were called within five minutes of putting our name on the waiting list!

The hostess seated us adjacent to the window overlooking the bay! SCORE!!! It did take about seven minutes for our waiter to come take our orders but we used the opportunity to review the menu and decide our options. We ordered a half dozen of oysters and the garlic cheese bread as appetizers with cioppino as our main entree, although my wife had hers prepared the 'lazy way', they shell the crab for you. The oysters were a little on the smaller side but were fully prepared for enjoying with the accompanying lemon, sauces and garnishes. The restaurant had already separated the meat of the oyster from the shell, a nice touch. I also ordered their 'Ultimate Dirty Martini' since it was a nice dinner and we didn't have to worry about driving. I'm not a big drinker but I ended up having two more...suffice to say I enjoyed them.

Our main course was delicious. There was plenty to fill the bowl, large chunks of fish, mussels, a couple clams, and a set of large crab legs reaching out! My bowl had a large 'knuckle' that was packed with meat. As I deshelled the crab legs I observed I had amassed significantly more meat through my labor than what my wife had been provided in her 'lazy style' bowl...in other words 'don't be lazy'. The broth was equally delicious although I would have preferred a little more broth...regardless I was still able to splash some on my coat.

We were too full to take a look at the dessert menu as the cioppino left us with a full belly and a big smile. Very happy that we were able to enjoy a very nice dinner with an incredible view and hardly any wait.

Until the next meal,

David

1544,Cliff W.,"I really took pleasure in the seafood here and I only had to wait 20 minutes for a Sunday lunch with family and friends! Great place to enjoy a meal with a view of the calm waters outside the restaurant windows. 

Started out with some sourdough bread as well as the Blue Cheese Garlic Bread. As if their complimentary sourdough isn't fresh and delicious enough, the blue cheese garlic bread takes it to the next level. Some of the dishes that stood out to me during this dining experience were the lobster tail, oysters, and famed clam chowder. The lobster tail was extremely fresh and sweet. Add a little dash of drawn butter into a cut of it and it's absolutely to die for. The oysters were a acceptable size and one dozen for 30 dollars is a steal. They were so delicious that I ordered two dozens! I can also see why their clam chowder is famous. It was creamy with the proper texture and contained fair amounts of clams and potato. I probably wouldn't order the extra crab and sour dough bowl again. Not worth it since the chowder was delicious on its own without those two additions. 

The crab legs and clams, however, were not as great as I expected. The steamed clams that we started off with tasted flavorless and contained bits of sand. The crab meat in the Shellfish Platter was quite bland as well though the meat looked fresh and intact in the legs. I will probably go with getting an entire Dungeness crab next time. I don't want to imply that the Shellfish Platter was poor in taste since the mussels and shrimp particularly were very appetizing. 

The service was great and the waitress checked in periodically to make sure everything was okay. Plates were swapped out and beverages were filled frequently. I will definitely return on my next visit to Fisherman's Wharf.

We chose a few lighter items and they were quite filling. The chowder was flavored well the salad was great with lots of crab meat. My wife enjoyed the heck out of what we would consider the cleanest tasting dungeoness crab ever.

I tried it out for the best Seafood at Pier 39? A popular tourist destination in San Francisco. I stumbled at Fog Harbor Fish House. My Host Friend confirmed about the Sustainability of the Restaurant. Sustainability... A first to my ear Let me realized how environmental friendly this restaurant was.

Its on the second level of Pier 39. They had a Majestic View of Golden Gate. Huge Windows to enjoy the best view while you enjoy your Dinning experience.....

Our Server Shawna was sooo welcoming.. Explained what sustainable Seafood they offer.  She suggested the Mix Grill with salmon, shrimp and swordfish with mash potato and broccoli. Loved her suggestion as this trio compliment with each other....

My Friend Got the Salmon. Its was moist and Loved it ...I had to steal half of his salmon too...

Last but not the least is their Award winning Clam Chowder....True Its must try..

For a first time Yelper..Im glad my friend informed me about this application...

But if you're willing to pay the price, they have pretty good food - particularly their clam chowder. This comes out piping hot, has the perfect consistency (creamy, but not overly so) and is a nice little break from walking around all day in the area. We also tried their dungeoness crab cocktail, which tasted fresh (though I wish they put the cocktail sauce on the side, instead of on top). This, dumped into your clam chowder is the perfect combination for a col San Francisco day.

I got the linguine with clams and it was so bland that I was very disappointed and decided to box it up so I can take it home and just season it and fix it myself. I was looking forward to this meal since my bf and I were stuck in San Francisco dealing with passport stuff and we finally got to the restaurant after walking 3 miles. We were excited because all the photos looked delicious. Well, let me just say that the food LOOKS better than it tastes. My bf had the cioppino (dont know if that's the correct spelling) and he was not impressed. I tried it, and it was SO. FREAKING. BLAND. Like seriously, has the chef ever heard of seasoning? It was literally just really great tasting fish drowning in a sad watery tomato sauce. The food has so much potential if only the people cooking it knew what to do. Maybe we came on an off day/time but I dont think we will be returning. Our waitress (pretty blonde girl, didnt catch her name) was very very friendly and attentive and the manager checked on us a few times which was nice. So, the restaurant has great staff,  they just need to learn how to season their food. I get that the restaurant is right on the water with a nice view but the prices are ridiculous. $20 for a boring pasta dish is just a joke.
