              " \"Fog harbor fish house, what can I say about this 5 star seafood gem on Pier 39?  I think I can say plenty.  \\n\\nFog Harbor is on the second level of Pier 39, I visited this weekend on a touristy trip to San Francisco.  I chose FH due to the Yelp reviews I read prior to traveling to San Francisco.  \\n\\nSaturday night dining, and here I thought I could make a 7pm reservation around noon and be good.  Haaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!  No way, 430 and 930 pm is what they had available.  I asked the hostess if they still accepted walk ins around 7pm or if it was reservation only, and she said they took walk ins but the wait could be 60-90 minutes.  FH is popular, and for good reason.\\n\\nAnyway, I digress, I discovered on yelp you can add yourself to the wait list.  Holy smokes!!!  What a brilliant feature.  So, I went to a bar and had a few drinks and added myself to the wait list and figured I'd be good to eat around 630 pm.  I also added that I was a first time diner and to dazzle me.\\n\\n I showed up at 624 Pm which is what the app recommended.  I was promptly seated in one of the best seats in the house.  Overlooking the marina, Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge.  And I was able to watch several sea lions frolic on the piers.  The view was Amazing at sunset, I couldn't have been seated in a better location.  \\n\\nI started out with a seafood tower, $88 price tag.  It had Maine lobster, oysters, mussels, shrimp, ceviche and crab legs.  It was very good, however; I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for value.  For the price, get another entree.  \\n\\nFor dinner I had the scallop and crab risotto.  It was awesome.  Risotto was cooked to perfection, scallops were cooked to perfection and the dish was delicious.  It was on the specials menu, and it was fantastic.  \\n\\nThey brought out the desert tray and of course I splurged since it was a weekend getaway.  Apple crisp, chocolate cake and crepe brûlée.  All 3 were outstanding.  I must also admit I had several cocktails, the Manhattan is outstanding as is the blood orange margarita.  \\n\\nOverall, I'm giving FH 5 stars, the location and view coupled with the meal, makes it a home run in my book and a must visit if you're ever in the area.\\n\",\n",
              " \"We went to SF to celebrate my brother in law's birthday, my brother in law is an excellent culinarian, so it was hard for me to find a place that would at least meet his expectations \\n\\nHis daughter told me that he rarely goes out to eat and when he goes he goes to Fog Harbor Fish House so we went\\n\\nWe were a group of 8 and a small service dog we were seated at a corner by the window on around table \\n\\nUnfortunately, I don't recall our server's name but he was Hispanic (maybe spaniel ) he was very knowledgeable and attentive without being pushy \\n\\nWe all started with a Moscow mule and clam chowder and they both were delicious \\nWe order at least 3 more rounds of mules \\n\\nWe also order two towers and they were good and enough for us all \\nWe asked for grilled chicken breast for our 4 legged son and he rushed the order \\n\\nThe desserts were the bomb especially the blondie, the bread putting and the apple crisp a la mode and they brought a dessert with a candle to the birthday boy \\n\\nMy daughter is a vegetarian and our wonderful server was able to make her feel welcome and very special \\n\\nI didn't give 5 stars because coffee was up to the rest of the food and the long wait\\n\",\n",
              " 'Nice little spot in the middle of Pier 39 where all the tourists congregate. Make a reservation or be prepared to wait - thankfully we did thru the YELP way in advance! Great location with a couple of sides having a view of the bay. As you might imagine, menu options are heavily on the seafood side but they have burgers and steaks too.......but..... \\n\\nI was torn with so many options but decided on the Cioppino. They offer a lazy option where all the seafood is \"shelled\" for you but this is one time I wasn\\'t going to be lazy. Count on getting messy with some random splatters as you enjoy the seafood tomato broth. There\\'s really no other way than to just \"get in there.\" Filled with crab, fish, clams, scallops, and mussels the bowl was well worth the $35 price tag.\\n\\nA rare gem considering the location of being in the middle of tourist central.\\n',\n",
              " \"The food was so good that I came here twice during my short stay in SF! \\n\\nBoth times I order the crab meat salad and they were loaded with crab meat! All the ingredients were really fresh - crisp romaine, unbruised avocado. I dont know what they use in their dressing, but it was GOOD! A perfect balance of tanginess and creaminess. I have to say the flavour wasn't as good the second time I had it, guess that proves it's house made and doesn't come from a bottle. \\n\\nWe ordered their famous clam chowder in the sourdough bread bowl. The chowder was definitely overhyped, it taste like ones you get at a regular western cuisine restaurant. I definitely expected more from a seafood focus restaurant by the pier.\\n\\nThe lobster tail was well cooked and the meat was mildly sweet. The favourite part of my meal was the pan fried scallop. It had a nice sear on the outside, but the interior was soft and supple.\\n\\nTheir seasonal special, pan fried scallop with crab meat risotto was also very good. Similar to the scallop in the lobster dish, the scallops in the risotto were perfectly cooked! The risotto was cooked al dente. Even though the photo looks like they gave us too much sauce, it was perfect once you start eating and enjoying the dish.\\n\\nWe wanted to try their fish, so we ordered the mixed grilled, which consisted of salmon, cod and shrimp. The salmon was decent, don't have much to comment on the shrimp but the cod was disappointing. It was stiff and flavourless (except for hints of saltiness from the seasoning)\\n\\nI would say it's worth the splurge to eat at Fog Habour every now and then, but choose your dishes wisely.\\n\",\n",
              " \"I've always wanted to try somewhere new and stumbled on this one. When I arrived to the place, I had a feeling this would be a tourist trap. It turns out it was.\\n\\nIt's right smack where Pier 39 is and located upstair. It gets tad crowded on the weekend. They have Yelp waitlist but if you have 9 people like we did, had to come in person and get on the list. Luckily it took us only 15 minutes. \\n\\nThe price is a bit steep but it's SF & at a tourist spot. We ordered couple appetizers to share such as oysters and calamari. I thought both were okay. Don't do oysters here. It's tinyyyyy! As for calamari, I felt like it was mostly batters, and not much squid. \\n\\nI also had clam chowder from a bread bowl. The chowder was okay. It's best to get a regular bowl because they give you the same bread for starter anyways.\\n\\nAs for the main course, I shared this seafood pasta. I think this was the best they have to offer. But still not good enough for me to come back or bring any of my guests back. They give a lot of seafood with this dish though! Overall, all the food was meh & not worth spending money on.\\n\",\n",
              " \"So far everything is very good.  I love Scomas's but decided to give this a try!  Had the crab cake appetizer comes with a little bit of greens and mango could be a little fatter on the cakes but good.  \\n\\nOur Waitress Gia is so nice didn't rush us to decide and was honest when given what I asked she gave it to me honestly and I appreciate that, otherwise might not like my dinner and nobodies happy so far excellent their clam chowder has won us over. Ok just got our entrees and they're beautiful!! Steak is perfect \\n\\nGotta go foods getting cold lol!!\\n\\nJust finished everything was really extremely good!  Coming back to celebrate my Birthday and my sons too!! \\n\\nTrust me peoples for me to rave about somewhere other than Scomas is amazing, but this restaurant was great I gave it four because they don't offer  scallops I love me some deep fried scallops with a little pasta and veggies. Also steak fries would be a better choice.  But still coming back with about 12 of us\\n\",\n",
              " \"We went to dinner at the Fog House last night and it was wonderful. Food was delicious and service was outstanding. It's located on Pier 39; you will need to walk up a flight of stairs. \\n\\nWe were seated at a table next to the window and the view was beautiful. We made reservations; I'm not sure if this helped with getting table with a view or not. \\n\\nI ordered a cocktail, an Alcatraz Escape and it was comparable to a Mai Tai. It was very tasty. We started with crab cakes as an appetizer and they were delicious. My husband and I both ordered lobster tails. Oh my! These babies were huge! Again, scrumptious. We ended with tiramisu. When my husband suggested it for dessert, I was hesitant since we weren't at an Italian restaurant. No worries, it was wonderful just like the rest of the meal. \\n\\nOur waitress was very friendly and attentive. She provided her personal favorites from the menu. \\n\\nThis restaurant was on the expensive side but we totally enjoyed our dinner. We also ordered the most expensive item on the menu (lobster tails $51) so you could get by with something not as expensive and I bet it would be equally delicious. My only negative comment is that it was a little loud. Highly recommend checking this restaurant out if you're in San Francisco.\\n\",\n",
              " \"We were staying in a hotel close to Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39. The concierge at our hotel gave us a coupon for Fog Harbor. We were doing a tour of Alcatraz that afternoon and decided we would eat at Fog Harbor that night. I added us to the wait list on yelp. It was a holiday weekend and the wait was over an hour.  \\n\\nIt's a large restaurant over looking the water. The tables are pretty close together but the view made up for it. They offered us regular menus, a seasonal menu, and a kids menu for our son. \\n\\nWe decided to order the crab ceviche appetizer. It was good because it was different. It wasn't your typical citrusy and acidic ceviche. It was prepared with coconut milk so it was creamy. It was very flavorful and fresh. \\n\\nFor our entrees, we split the cioppino and the mixed grill plate. The cioppino was very good. Spicy broth and lots of fresh seafood. The mixed grill had shrimp skewers, salmon, and cod. It had really good flavor and was fresh. It was served with mashed potatoes and green beans. \\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered the apple walnut one. It was crunchy on top with oatmeal and had a scoop of ice cream on top. \\n\\nThe service was incredible, the food was amazing, and the view was beautiful. Definitely check it out if you're looking for a nice dinner on the pier.\\n\",\n",
              " 'Go for the ambiance and the fact that they utilize the Yelp waitlist. Stay for a cocktail and a tasty bread bowl.\\n\\nFisherman\\'s Wharf is full of tourist traps - the good news is that Fog Harbor isn\\'t one of \\'em. Legit seafood, water views, linen tablecloths, etc. And they have \"world famous\" chowder. \\n\\nI dined with a group and most everyone didn\\'t order the expected Cippino, chowder or, Crab Louie salad. So of course I had to! Dungenesd crab cocktail and a Caesar/bread bowl combo. Sometimes appetizers are the way to go. Though I wouldn\\'t say the chowder was famous, it was good! Creamy and full of tasty fishy bits.\\n\\nIf you\\'re stopping in for a drink and a bite, I\\'d recommend the Lemondrop martini, as it feels very SF and goes well with seafood.\\n',\n",
              " \"Craving fresh sourdough bread? Come to Fog Harbor Fish House and try their signature bread!\\n\\nWe spent the whole day in San Francisco and decided to have a sit-down meal at the Fisherman's Wharf Pier 39 to enjoy the atmosphere and a fresh seafood dinner. Initially, we used the Yelp app to put our name on the wait list, however, you know San Francisco traffic can be very unpredictable and made us tardy for our assigned time. When we arrived, the hostess put us back on the list again but since we were starving, I asked about the bar seating. It was opening seating and first come first serve. Luckily, there were enough seats for our party, and we sat at the bar with the attentive service from both bartenders. \\n\\nAs we sat down, we were served fresh sourdough rolls with butter on the side. We immediately devoured the rolls as they were warm, straight out the oven with a light sourness and chewy texture to it. This was worth sitting in SF traffic.\\n\\nWe ordered the award-winning clam chowder in the fresh house baked sourdough bread bowl ($12) as our appetizer. The bowl was generous and included the top of the bread which we used to sink into the soup. The hot soup was creamy and very comforting. For one person, that could be a meal itself. We all shared it and agreed it was the highlight of our meal.\\n\\nFor our entrée, we ordered the Mixed Grill ($31) with grille salmon, Pacific cod, and shrimp, citrus beurre blanc sauce, sautéed vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes. The four shrimps were on a skewer and we used the beurre blanc sauce to dip each one. The two cuts of fish were moist and flavorful. The garlicky green beans were outstanding! We also ordered the Fish and Chips (too bready) and the Grilled Salmon with steamed broccoli. The servings for all the dishes were appropriate for the price and service was well maintained at the bar. \\n\\nWe opted out for dessert elsewhere and were definitely full from our meal with the highlight being the sourdough bread and soup.\\n\\nIf you don't mind sitting side by side, I'd highly recommend putting your name on the waiting list but keep an eye out for the bar seating as they serve the exact same menu and it could be a quicker option.\\n\\nThey validate for one hour at the parking lot so bring your ticket.\\n\\nOverall, Fog House Fish House was an excellent choice to fulfill our seafood craving in San Francisco.\\n\",\n",
              " \"You get what you pay for...and this place proves the wisdom of that adage.  From start to finish...this is a place I can proudly recommend others to try.  Of course, the place gets quite crowded, especially during holidays and weekends, so it's best to make reservations.  Really worth it to phone ahead.\\n\\nThe food was great!  Everything came well-cooked and well-flavoured.  It should be the same with other upscale seafood restaurants.  But what sets this place above the others is the speed and the quality of the service!  Our server (sorry I did not get her name) worked wonders.  Her recommendations were sound, her appeal was above-board, her speed was unbelievable, and her humour made the experience memorable!\\n\\nMy family and I came here during the Labour Day weekend, for a short San Francisco break to see the sights and sounds of the Bay.  And now, this restaurant has become a landmark for me and my family.  Highly recommended!\\n\",\n",

We came here around 11ish. The wait was only about 10 mins and the restaurant was not that packed yet. \\n\\nFor appetizer we decided to order the following dishes:\\n\\nBlue cheese garlic bread  - This dish had fresh sourdough topped with blues cheese, herbs and garlic. I'm not a fan of blue cheese and this tasted ok. I ended up scraping all the blue cheese off the bread and it tasted better. \\n\\nCrispy Calamari - This dish has fried jalapeños and onions served with lemon aioli. This was yummy! \\n\\nDungeness crab ceviche - This had coconut milk, jalapeño, cilantro, mango, fresh lime, tomato and toasted coconut with tortilla chips. This one tasted ok. The mixture of the crab and mango had a alright taste. This was only serviced with about 3-4 pieces of tortilla chips. \\n\\nFor the main dish, I ended up ordering the Linguini & Clams. At $22, this dish had fresh clams, olive oil, tomatoes, garlic, white wine and butter topped with parmesan cheese. This dish serving is only good for one person. There is a ok amount of pasta in the dish and clams. I think that other restaurant gives you more. The bread that was in the dish was crunchy and hard and was quite spicy for my liking but over all the dish was good. \\n\\nOther dishes that we ordered are the pan-seared chicken breast. This had sautéed spinach, pearl onions, mushroom herb sauce and garlic mashed potatoes. We also ordered a bowl of their award winning clam chowder too. \\n\\nOverall, we all enjoyed the food we got and service was good.\\n\",\n",

The mixed grill might be a good option for someone who is indecisive because it includes multiple types of seafood. I ordered the halibut special off the seasonal specials menu. It was a hefty portion of halibut and while it was fresh it was somewhat plain. I would've loved to douse it in some kind of chili oil, but I don't think they mess with that over here. I would've settled for sriracha, but I don't think they have that either. \\n\\nI did really enjoy a cup of their clam chowder, which they tout all over the menu and website that it's award winning. You know what though, it does taste award-winning, as there was plenty of clam meat in each bite. They really tried to upsell me on adding crab to the clam chowder, but I didn't bite.\\n\\nOur server was attentive and helpful with helping us pick from their monstrous menu.

A better server came to serve the main course.\\n\\nQuality of soup was very good in my opinion but my date said they have tried better soup. I found the grilled fish to be fresh and the sauce on the salty side but they had a good variety of seafood and everything tasted great. We found that there was no clam meat in the broth/ sauce as promised. As for the price I don't think that it's worth paying so much money for medium sized portions. I think they are mainly charging for the service, cleanliness and location. But if your budget allows it please order more than two main entrees (for a couple) if you are really hungry.\\n\\nI have to say that it's a very romantic spot and they have polite servers.

I appreciated the menu picture book that our waiter offered us to give us a better idea of the food. Baked oysters were cheesy and good. Chicken penne was alright and my friend didn't finish her food. Mixed greens were your typical fresh salad.

The place claimed that their chowder is an award-wining one. Naturally, I was skeptical and almost stopped my mum from ordering, but, boy, I was very wrong. Unlike other chowders I've had, the chowder here was perfectly balance. It was creamy, but not too buttery, and had just the right amount of salt. Not to mention, the generous amount of crab and clam chunks that were in it! I really loved dipping the baguette into the chowder; the baguette itself was also very delicious. It was crispy on the outside and warm and pillowy on the inside. Just the bread and butter can take you places.\\n\\nNext was the Shellfish Platter. It certainly was a show-stopping dish. It came with a pile of boiled and grilled clams, mussels, shrimps, dungess crabs, and the extra lobster tail. Everything was heftily drowsed in garlic, butter, and oil - what could go wrong. Every seafood on the dish was fresh and perfectly cooked. I don't know how they do it, but they did! The fingerling potatos were roasted well and soso flavorful. \\n\\nThe Mixed Grill consisted of grilled shrimps, salmon filet, and cod filet, with a side of stir-fried string beans and garlic mash potato. The seafood was good; my favorite was the salmon, which had a distinct salinity to it that I really enjoyed. But what really got me were the string beans!! There was a delicious wok smokiness to them that made it impossible for me to stop going back for more.\\n\\nAgain, I had a divine meal here last night and would definitely reccommend anyone in the area to come check this amazing place out.\\n\",\n",

Last time, this place had a long line-up so this time I came 10min after opening to grab the best seat by the window.\\n\\nOne note I\\'ll like to mention was that I arrived as a solo dinner. I was greeted by a very unwelcoming tone.  The hostess asked \" Hello....may I help you..??\" in a way that I don\\'t belong there and was there to give her hassle. It was when I replied \"Do you take a table for one?\" was when she realized I was there to dine in. I will appreciate if she had greeted me more pleasantly and politely, just a simply, \"Good Day Madam, would you like a table for one?\" Or \"Hello, for one?\" will be nice. That\\'s one star gone! So The 4-stars are for the food and waiter.\\n\\nAmbience: The dining area is very spacious and surrounded by large glass window looking out the fisherwharf bay. If you get a seat by the window, you get a good view of the sea lions sun bathing and a fabulous view of the whole Alcatraz island. \\n\\nClam Chowder: It is indeed award winning soup! The base was very creamy and thicken, not too salty. It was filled with chunky clam meats which is delightful as many other clam chowder versions at other restaurants aren\\'t that generous. The sourdough bread gives a perfect touch to complete the taste. \\n\\nSeafood Cioppino: First off, the seafood varieties are very very fresh. The dish had crabs, clams, mussels, scallops and fish; being a picky fish eater, the fish meat in this dish had no strong after taste but full of sweetness and flaky texture. The tomato base broth has a thick texture with chucky tomatoes bites and has just a tad of heat to compliment the freshness of the seafood. Overall a truely satisfying dish for seafood lovers.\\n',\n",

We made a reservation the day of for 2 people at 12:30PM with no issue. If you forget to make a reservation beforehand they do let you add yourself to their waitlist on Yelp. \\n\\nIf you decide to come here meals will cost you at ~$20+ but their clam chowder is only $9 for a bowl, $11 in a bread bowl, and $18 to top it with crab. Great option to get on a gloomy day! I also ordered their fish & chips ($19) and was satisfied with the dish. For $19 I think the portions were a great size and I definitely felt stuffed after. The meal comes with 3 large pieces of beer battered fish that has a crispy outside, side of coleslaw, and nicely thin cut/crisp french fries. The server also brought over some malted vinegar to top if off with. \\n\\n*They also serve complimentary bread/butter that they bake fresh every day \\n\\nFor being such a busy place I liked how they had enough servers to handle the lunch rush and the servers were attentive enough but let you have your space during your meal. \\n\\nOverall Fog Harbor is a solid spot to crab any of your seafood needs (fried calamari, clam chowder, whole crab, pasta, and sandwiches) with great views of Alcatraz and the sea lions.\\n\",\n",

I also tried the award-winning clam chowder, and their fish special of the day. I opted for the clam chowder in a regular bowl rather than the bread bowl.

There was enough butter/grease on the plate that I could tip the plate and dump out a cup of it. I love that the dish was buttery, and appreciated the drawn butter in a cup on the side (and dunked my succulent crab meat in it), but the potatoes, the green beans; everything was drenched in buttery grease. A light coating should have sufficed, but I'm not joking when I say that my plate had a pool of it underneath all the food. My stomach didn't feel all that great for about 24 hours after my meal - kind of the same feeling I have after eating movie theater popcorn where the butter was a bit heavy handed.

So we sad at the bar and order some drinks while waiting. I had an \"Alcatraz Escape\" a rum cocktail similar to a rum runner and my husband got the \"Patron Margarita.\"\\n\\nThe restaurant has a beautiful view and is located on Pier 39 on a second floor. The host took us to our table at our reservation time. She was friendly and polite. \\n\\nThe menu has appetizers, seafood, salads, pasta, and steaks. I saw they have an \"Award winning clam chowder\" so we had to try it! We got two cups and some calamari as starters. The clam chowder was amazing! Really good and unique. The calamari was delicious as well; big serving. \\n\\nWe had a bottle of Viognier with the appetizers and we ordered the \"Seared scallops with Crab risotto\" for me and the \"Garlic roasted Crab\" for my husband. Our server also brought us two delicious bread buns. They were warm and delicious! \\n\\nThe food came out promptly and everything was beyond my expectations. My food was just fantastic! The scallops were a little too small but they were cooked perfectly and the crab risotto was the best! It had so much crab! The roasted crab was great as well it came with fingerling potatoes. Excellent. \\n\\nAs we finish our meal I was a little disappointed because there was no sign of dessert or anybody coming to sign happy birthday to my husband. So we decided to order a \"Tiramisú\" I have no problem with paying off the dessert or anything but since I put it in the reservation I thought they would show some type of appreciation. I had some birthday candles on my purse (luckily!) So I asked our waitress for a lighter so that I could sign happy birthday. She cane and wish a happy birthday and smile and when she brought the bill they gave us the dessert for free. I know it was not her fault. Whoever check the reservation didn\\'t inform her. \\n\\nOverall, I love the food and the restaurant. I give them 4.4 stars and definitely looking forward to come back and try more delicious food.\\n',\n",

Not just the BS friendly but legit made conversation and chatted it up with us about fantasy football. Bravo to him for knowing some Falcons players. Friendly, attentive and interactive with the kiddos! The food- it was actually hella good. I was skeptical because it's a touristy restaurant in one of THE most touristy places in the city but it didn't disappoint. My husband had the skirt steak- who am I kidding- I had his skirt steak too because it was that yummy. I did the crab cakes which were perfect- and I'm a picky little B when it comes to crab cakes. Kiddos had chowder, grilled shrimp and chicken strips (chicken strips kid is mine ). We also ordered the blue cheese garlic bread and holy smokes that was so good!

I told her I\\'d been texted that our table was ready. She asked for my name and phone number - twice - and made a big deal out of going through the computer and talking to another employee. The second employee finally \"found\" our name on the waiting list, and told the hostess we were texted to arrive. The hostess made it a point to glare at me and say, \"When we text you, we expect you to arrive immediately.\" \\n\\nI replied, \"Look, if you don\\'t have a table for us, we\\'re fine going elsewhere\" and started to walk away. She was all smiles and welcoming after that, but it definitely left a sour taste in my mouth.\\n\\nThe girl that brought us back to our table did apologize for the \"reception\", but really, if you know you have a jerk like that working for you, do you really want to make her the first person your guests encounter? Our waiter was friendly, at least, and made it a point to welcome us and discuss the menu and their specials for the day. \\nOur table was right next to a window, so we had a nice view of the bay and Fisherman\\'s Wharf below. \\n\\nWe got an order of calamari to share, and I went with a cup of their (\"world famous\") clam chowder and the Ahi Tuna Poke for my meal. My husband ordered the Lobster Roll because he\\'s still kicking himself for not having one the last time we were in Boston.\\n\\nThe calamari and a basket of sourdough bread rolls came out at about the same time. The calamari was good, but it also came with deep-fried jalapenos (the second time in San Francisco that a restaurant served jalapenos with their calamari. Odd.) It was served with a standard tartar sauce, nothing exceptional.\\n\\nThe clam chowder was good - creamy with lots of chunks of clam and potato. They say it\\'s award-winning (The Best in San Francisco). The poke wasn\\'t my favorite. They served it on a bed of diced mango, which overpowered the flavor of the fish. It also only came with four small wonton crisps, which wasn\\'t enough for the plate.\\n\\nMy husband was similarly underwhelmed by his lobster roll. At $27 a pop, he was expecting an explosion of lobster. And, to be fair, when it landed in front of him, it did look quite impressive. But it was all smoke and mirrors, as the brioche bun they used for bread was cut in a way so that the lobster sat on top while looking as though there was a whole lot more on the inside.\\n\\nWith all the wonderful restaurants in San Francisco, I just wouldn\\'t come back.\\n',\n",

Our server was super nice too, he took time with us to give us recommendations and even saved us some money because originally we were going to get the clam chowder bread bowl but he told us the bottomless bread is the same type and we could just use that! We also ordered the mussels and penne, crab, and a seafood medley with lobster, scallops and I think more crab mixed with a yummy red sauce. \\n\\nAnd we were celebrating my husband's birthday that weekend - they did not hesitate to offer us one of their desserts on the menu for free. \\n\\nAmbience: during the holidays, they have Xmas decorations everywhere and lights.

The dessert menu was omg.. so cool but def an incredible way for them to be able to sell the dessert because our waiter brought out a tray with ALL of them on it and man --how can you say no when they ALL look so good.. \\n\\nDef worth going to but not incredibly terrible if you take a trip and miss this spot.

Since my friend and I always over order, we added the shrimp. The clam chowder was nice and creamy with a good amount of clams. A little thicker than I prefer, but still a good bowl. The crab was a little disappointing. There wasn't enough garlic flavor. Plus, the best part of the crab, the head, was missing. It was just an empty shell for decoration. If a restaurant states a whole crab, I think that should include the head. The shrimp were okay. Had a nice heat, but I didn't really like the sauce. A little too sweet for me. Dinner came with complimentary Bread & Butter, which was good for soup dipping.\\n\\nService here was nice and friendly. They were busy cuz there was a convention in town, so there were times when we had to flag down our server. The wine was good and paired well with our food. Both cocktails were okay.

On my first visit, we were just walk ins and since there was a wait for a table, we opted for the bar (we were in a rush to get to our Alcatraz night tour!). I enjoyed sitting at the bar and our bartender was friendly and personable. I did find myself turning around a lot though to look out those big beautiful windows overlooking the Bay. \"Next time I come here, I want to sit by a window!\" I thought to myself. The first time I was there I got the seafood ravioli and it was FANTASTIC! I still think about it often. Might be some of the best ravioli I\\'ve ever had! \\n\\nTwo years later, I made my way back and was smart enough to make reservations. Just as I said last time, I was able to sit near one of those windows! Although it was rainy out and was starting to get dark, I still enjoyed the experience overlooking the Bay. I imagine it\\'s much prettier on a nice day out. \\n\\nOn this second trip I was DEVASTATED to hear that they took the seafood ravioli off the menu. Booo!! Our waiter was pretty tenured because he knew what I was talking about and was even able to say \"It\\'s probably been a few years since you\\'ve been here, right?\" Ugh dang it! I opted for the seafood penne instead. As we waited for our food to come out, I ordered a glass of Duckhorn Sauvignon Blanc. Our waiter also brought us out some delicious warm bread with whipped butter! YUM! Although unfortunately that was the highlight of my meal. My seafood penne came out and it was just very underwhelming. I didn\\'t like it that much and couldn\\'t stop thinking about the ravioli. I don\\'t want to dock too many stars for this though because I think I just simply ordered the wrong thing. My sister got the clam chowder in a bread bowl and it was REALLY good! There are many other dishes here that I\\'d like to try in the future. \\n\\nOverall, great atmosphere, views, and food. Would love to see them bring back the ravioli again in the future!\\n',\n",

If there\\'s a wait, I would honestly try your luck somewhere else. You won\\'t be missing out on anything if you don\\'t dine here. My favorite part of my meal was endless sourdough rolls with delicious delicious whipped butter. My weakness is sourdough bread, so much so that I got the \"Award Winning Clam Chowder\" in the sourdough bread bowl. Ok so disclaimer: I have been living in New England for the last 2 years and have had clam chowder in Maine and Boston and I wasn\\'t too impressed with the clam chowder here. It\\'s just OK... I do love the sourdough bread bowl because bread hellooo. I also split the linguini & clams with my mom and wasn\\'t a huge fan of the flavor. Once again just an OK dish. The pasta and clams were cooked well but you definitely should use the lemon wedge that comes with the dish to add some acid to the flavor. Really all the dishes here seem to be just good enough.

We were back on the pier the next day, however, and the drinks and calamari from the day before were so good we decided to give it another go.

Then I decided to try that award winning chowda and found out WHY it had won awards! O...M....GEEJUS that was DELECTABLE! We all ordered it topped with the Dungeness crab and boy do they top it. It was rich and creamy...worth every calorie! I ordered the Cioppino, which is a seafood soup, and found the tomato base to be a little overpowering for my taste buds. This time I tried the Lipstick Lemondrop which was underwhelming due to the lack of alcohol. Probably will not return, but if you decide to go the chowder, calamari, and Alcatraz are all must tries.

It contained just six large shrimp, tossed with thin slices of onions and bell peppers in an intense chili sauce.

I also couldn't help but try a cup of their award-winning clam chowder ($7), which was so creamy and had large meaty clam pieces. Yum, this is a must!  \\n\\nFor my entree, I went with a lighter plate, being the Seared Pacific Cod ($28). The fish was seared perfectly with a golden brown, slightly crisp top. It was served with white beans, chorizo butter, tomatoes and spinach, then finished with a dab of garlic shallot aioli. The aioli added an extra layer of flavor to an already savory plate and I loved the white beans as an alternative for a starch. With the Cod placed on top of it all, it was truly the highlight of the dish. Two of my family members ordered the Mixed Grill, which was a combo of salmon, cod and shrimp served with vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes.

Seafood platter was so flavorful, Cioppino was a bit on the salty side but overall good flavor. We put in the linguini from the platter into coppino at the end and when the pasta soaked up all the sauce, that was just a satisfying ending. We also dipped fresh sourdough bread with the coppino sauce, another excellent carb ending to the meal!\\n',\n",

Many restaurants seem to focus on shellfish dishes and forget that a quality fillet can be just as satisfying to some restaurant-goers but the Fog Harbor chefs clearly understand what they're doing in the kitchen! The fish was flaky and well-seasoned, the spinach was a perfect al dente texture, and the caper beurre blanc was salty and creamy without being too heavy. \\n\\nOur drinks were a little disappointing, however. One glass of wine came from a bottle that tasted as if it had been opened a day or two too long and the ginger lemonade, although refreshing and full of fresh ginger, lacked the oomph I expected.\\n\\nI'd be happy to bring friends and family back to Fog Harbor for the seafood but will save our drink orders for a different place.\\n\",\n",

Wowza, I could see why! Forget Boudin, this is the winner right here. They give you so much variety and freshness of seafood in this bowl of goodness right here. Plus, no need for a bread bowl when they serve complimentary sourdough bread for the table. IMO, dipping the bread and soaking up all the chowder flavor is much better than having a bread bowl. Mmm!\\n\\n* Jumbo Scallop & Crab Risotto ($35) - SEASONAL ITEM. Wow again. These were some of the best scallops I've ever had in my life. They were so buttery and juicy and perfectly seared. The risotto was creamy and the crab made it even more flavorful. The dab of pesto was a nice touch. \\n\\n* Cioppino ($34) - Ok to be fair, by the time this came out, I had stuffed myself silly with sourdough bread and the above two dishes. This was still amazing though. Very flavorful and wonderfully decorated with an abundant of seafood. No tough pieces, everything F R E S H. Note, they provide you bibs so don't be afraid to get the cioppino the normal way (and opt out of the additional $6 services for the ready-to-eat way). \\n\\nAll their menu items come from 100% sustainable seafood.

Food though was sub par, especially for the price.  The seafood was so so.  Following is a breakdown of what we ordered.\\nAppetizers\\nCalamari- crunchy batter.  Well seasoned.  Had only 1 dipping sauce.  4/5 stars\\nSteamed clams- broth was good, great flavors.  Actual clams were very small and not cooked well. 3/5\\nBaked oysters- this was so over priced.   $37 for a dozen, and man were they small!!  They should put \"baby oysters\" under their description of it because it was that small.  They are not worth it at all.  Yea the sauce and topping on it was good, but its not worth $37. 1/5\\nGarlic bread with blue cheese.  Bread was toasted well and the blue cheese is really in your face.  But it was a good balance.  4/5\\nMain course\\nLightly seared ahi tuna steak with garlic jasmine rice and vegetables.  The ahi tuna was nice and thick.  Barely seared edges with the nice raw interior.  Taste was good.  But the soy sauce on the rice was just too much!!  Made it way to salty and unpalatable.  3/5\\nClam chowder with crab meat on top was really good.  The chowder was thick and creamy.  And the crab meat (extra $7) was well worth the cost.  Large chunks of crab meat and they were pretty generous with the amount of crab meat they put on it.  Most definitely the best thing I had here.  5/5\\nDrink\\nMoscow mule.  Amount of alcohol they put in it was light.  And for $14 I would have expected a lot more alcohol content.  Flavors tho were light.  Wish it had a fruitier flavor to it.  There was also too much ice in it and it really watered down the flavor. 2/5.\\n\\nFor 5 people and drinks the bill came out to over $380.  Location is great but for the price you\\'re only really paying for the view.  Because the food here... was not impressive.   I had fresher seafood (better cooked as well) in Denver #pappadeaux.\\n',\n",

However we were delayed when the F line car we were riding on terminated it's trip early rather than continuing on to fishermen's wharf.  Thus we had to get off and wait for the next car.  Rather than being early we could now see that we would be 10-15 minutes late. I immediately called the restaurant to inform them.  The hostess brusquely states tables would only be held 10 minutes and then we would be put at the back of the waitlist.  This created stress and hurrying, but we made it 5 minutes late and we did get a nice window seat in the end.  \\n\\nThe clam chowder in a bread bowl was good.  The fried shrimp was ok. I think I could have ordered something better than this. The waiter serving us was excellent.  \\n\\nThe original experience with the hostess on the phone really was off putting though.  Several people on the F line overhead my end of the conversation and advised me to no show and find another restaurant.  I'm glad we made it. The rest of the staff compensated for the poor attitude by the hostess.\\n\",\n",

              " 'I didn\\'t have a specific place in mind for dinner while we were in the Fisherman\\'s Wharf area so I pulled up the Yelp app.  Fog Harbor Fish House had the most solid reviews and was in the direction that we were heading in, Pier 39. Sweet!\\n\\nWe got to the Pier and realized it was on the 2nd floor of the little shopping area, but luckily there was an escalator (and we found out later an elevator) to get my kiddo\\'s stroller up there.  Traveling with kids makes things a bit tricky sometimes, but getting to this restaurant is manageable.  They do ask that you park your stroller outside in their pretty little sitting area though and the hostesses will keep an eye on it for you.\\n\\nWe didn\\'t have a reservation, but were seated right away and it seemed like we came in right before the dinner rush.  Perfect timing as always!  The restaurant has big, beautiful windows and our table looked out into Pier 39.  Now THIS is the way to enjoy the pier without having to deal with the wind and cold, folks. It was a cold, cold day and the warm restaurant was a welcomed reprieve.\\n\\nThe menu offers a solid seafood selection with specials featured on a separate menu.  I ordered the lazy cioppino (recommended by our waiter vs. the regular cioppino) which was an added $5.  I really wanted seafood and I figured this is the best way to get a taste of a little bit of everything!  My husband went with our waiter\\'s suggestion as well -- the Alaskan Halibut which came with pearl couscous, angula pesto, and a balsamic glaze.  Apparently it\\'s only available 1 month out of the year.\\n\\nOur food came out quickly and from the moment we dug into our meal to the very last bite, we were ooooo-ing and aaaahh-ing.  Getting my cioppino \"lazy\" was totally worth it.  I didn\\'t have to spend time trying to break the crab legs and digging the meat out which often times is frustrating for me.  I just want to eat!  Lol.  The scallops were cooked perfectly, the crab delicious, and all the flavors married well.  I\\'m more of a white / cream sauce type of girl, but the tomato broth was really delicious and had a bit of a kick to it as well.  My husband absolutely loved his dish.  He noted that it needed a bit of salt, but concluded that it was the best fish he\\'s probably ever had.  As a cook himself, he can sometimes be critical of restaurants, but not this time.  Our bellies were full and praises were sung.\\n\\nWe were pleasantly surprised and impressed with our experience.  Our waiter was so attentive and never left us waiting or wanting.  He came out with the dessert menu, which is actual examples of the desserts arranged on a tray, but I was full and content.\\n\\nI would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to try fresh seafood with a great view!  You\\'re in the Bay after all!  Just get there early as the restaurant was PACKED by the time we left.\\n',\n",

HAHA WOOPS. Deceptively strong.\\n\\nAlso, huge props to their overall quality of service. I really hate children, and we happened to be next to two loud af toddlers who decided their paper mats were good for makeshift confetti.

The mussels were perfectly cooked and marinated in the white wine broth. There was a subtle taste coming from the roasted garlic and a sweet tang from the tomatoes. A beautifully well executed dish I must say. \\n\\nAs for the clam chowder bowl, the sourdough bread felt as it was freshly baked from the oven. The exterior of the bread was still nice and crunchy and the inside was soft like marshmallows. The clam chowder had chunks of potatoes, bits of chopped clam and also had a rich tasting cream broth. The juices from clams and cream were in perfect harmony which provided that sweet and savory component to the dish. I very much enjoyed since I am a huge sourdough fanatic. I highly recommend this to others!\\n\\nMy overall experience was a superb one. Their customer service was right on the dime and the quality of seafood was worth every penny.

No doughs about that. Our server was amazing and super awesome. I forgot her name but she was so attentive despite it being a full house. \\nThe food itself was a letdown. We ordered the clam chowder, half dozen orders and the seafood platter with add on lobster tail in herbs and butter. The entire meal was pretty much a miss for me. Let me explain fish by dish:\\n\\nChowder - they added bacon to it. I love bacon and yet bacon couldn't save this dish for me. It just tasted weird like they added lemon to it or something. It had a sour undertone for a cream soup but it didn't taste spoiled.\\n\\nOysters - these were pretty fresh and local according to our server. No clue what they were though but they were tiny. Decent though and my fave for the night.\\n\\nThe seafood platter was huge and came with dungeoness crabs, mussels, clams, jumbo shrimp, and fingerling potatoes, plus one lobster tail add on. \\n\\nThe lobster was pretty bad. The texture was obviously over cooked and very dry. The crabs while a lot (and usually I'd be jumping with joy) was pretty dry and overdone. So we're the clams. Only the mussels and shrimps were cooked just right. Maybe it's because they baked this dish and over did it but I think steaming it would have preserved the sweetness and juiciness of the dish. \\n\\nTax and tip came out to be $170 USD. Really not worth it in my opinion. Not because of portion because we were full but because it just wasn't very tasty. We wanted fresh juicy seafood in SF and instead got over cooked dry seafood that could have been previously frozen for all we know. \\n\\nThis might have been a one off experience but being out of town, this was our first and def our last experience there.

The calamari is one of the best I've tried, and I'm a huge sea food lover. It's paired with fried onions and jalapeños. The dipping is a creamy aioli sauce that truly brings out the flavor of the calamari. For the entree, I usually order the linguini and clams. The amount of clams that's served is unbelievable!

It was very soft and yummy. I think it had a really good texture and the overall taste was pleasant. 8/10\\n\\nNext, we got half a dozen of raw oysters and it was not worth the price. It was really really small oysters and I have definitely gotten bigger and better tasting oysters for a cheaper price. 2/10\\n\\nI had the lobster tail and it was good but not spectacular. I felt that it was over priced because it didn't taste any different than other lobsters I have eaten before. The mash potatoes were really buttery and the beans were also really crunchy and tasty. Overall, it was delicious but not worth the price. 7/10\\n\\nI also tried a little of the cioppino and it was really good. The tomato sauce was very tasty but they gave very little crab in my opinion. \\n\\nIn terms of quantity, I think this restaurant is on the pricier side since it is located in a very touristy area. Also, at the beginning of the meal, they only served two small pieces of bread which I thought was strange since most restaurants give a large bread basket. However, I would come back here for a special occasion and try their crab.\\n\",\n",

Also, I got a 15% off coupon after purchasing tickets to the aquarium and from the welcome center, which was a bonus. My friend and I were quickly seated by the windows with a view and the service was great. They offer a lot of seatings with a view so that\\'s pretty cool.

When she turns around to walk past our table, she stops and smiles at us and simply says, \"sorry girls, I know you wanted that table.\"  Okay?

I\\'ve been a server before and if I knew my table wasn\\'t given a table by the window the first time around but another one opened up, I would\\'ve gone and asked before they asked me.

The oysters (king of the north) were perfect. My bf loved the steam clams, especially the addition of cilantro which was impossibly balanced within the broth. I had the cioppino - it was overflowing with seafood. Service (Adam and Michael) was quick, attentive, and thoughtful. A memorable meal of our first day in San Francisco.

The clams were fresh and the ratio of clam to soup was very high. The sourdough bread was really good too and I typically don't enjoy sourdough. Based on the plates passing by our table I knew I had to save room for my meal so I tried to show restraint.\\n\\nI ordered the Scallops with crab risotto. The scallops were large, fresh and perfectly seared. The lemon and white wine sauce they rested in was phenomenal. The risotto just wow. Risotto is easy to ruin but this one was creamy and flavorful. The sprouts in top gave added texture and the grape tomatoes provided the acid. The crab inside the risotto was from the claw which is my favorite. This crab was very fresh and not over cooked. This meal was one of the top five meals I have ever eaten. Well worth the $35 price tag.\\n\",\n",

We have tried their seasonal entrees as well as the permanent menu items such as the filet mignon and the food is always incredible.

You know how most restaurants give you crappy frozen vegetables on the side and it seems like an afterthought?  Not here.  They had green beans, asparagus, and red pepper and they were seasoned well, crispy and delicious.  Others tried the lobster, salmon BLTs, veggie burgers, oyster platter and much more.

Not my jam.\\n\\nNow, the last 2 times I came I was with 6-8 people and we got good tables facing the water in the main room.  Muchhhhhh better and more comfortable!\\n\\nAmbiance: 4-5 stars for the main dining room.

I can't recommend any of it, except Alcatraz and the free arcade museum, which are pretty cool. Anyway, visitors need to check these places off their list, and if you are showing off SF, your gonna end up around here.\\n\\nThe views are wonderful, and after a day of all the tourist nonsense at pier 39, a sit down restaurant with cloth napkins sounds pretty inviting. Everything else is good, not great. The staff are capable but always spread thin. The seafood is good, but not notably so. The prices are quite high .... again, justified by the location alone. \\n\\nI always feel a little bad about bring my tourist friends here, as it is not nearly the best of what SF has to offer in seafood, or even just dining, but a failure to plan anything else and exhausted kids and relatives always has me ending up here.

We can't remember the last time we came out here but decided to go enjoy the fresh seafood San Francisco has to offer. Fog Harbor Fish House was the top of all the Pier 39 restaurant lists that I saw and that's where we stopped for lunch after checking out the aquarium. \\n\\nThe restaurant was located on the second floor, across from the aquarium exit (how convenient). It's also next to the California Welcome Center so stop by there as well to get a one hour free parking validation and coupon book. The coupon book included a free garlic blue cheese appetizer with purchase of any entree that you could use. Fog Harbor also provides one hour of parking validation for the garage across the street.\\n\\nAt a little after 11am on a Sunday (on Pride weekend too), there was no wait. You can make reservations ahead of time online but it's limited. The restaurant actually saves most of their tables for walk in guests. The restaurant did get pretty crowded by the time we left and there were people waiting outside for their table. \\n\\nWe had a table by the window and had a great view of the pier and Golden Gate Bridge. Their menu is pretty extensive but I had a chance to look on Yelp ahead of time to plan out what I wanted to order.\\n\\nFor a party of 4 adults and 1 toddler, we ordered the following items:\\n- crab cakes\\n- calimari\\n- 2 bowls of the clam chowder (+ added the Dungeness crab)\\n- shellfish platter for 2\\n- whole garlic roasted Dungeness crab\\n\\nThe freshly made sourdough bread was warm and delicious. It tasted even better when dipped in the garlic butter from the shellfish platter or roasted garlic Dungeness crab. Overall, everything tasted good considering this is a touristy area. The shellfish platter and Dungeness crab are good picks for said fans. Like I said earlier, it's the roasted garlic and garlic butter  that makes the difference and I'm not even a seafood fan. While the clam chowder was nice and creamy, it was pretty heavy and filling as well. I wouldn't opt for their bread bowl since you're already given sourdough bread. The only disappointing item we ordered would probably have to be the crab cakes. I wasn't a fan of the crab filling.\\n\\nOur server was friendly but kinda left us alone after our main entrees came out. We had to ask about our appetizers towards the end because he forgot about them. Luckily, it didn't take too long before they came out.\\n\\nThe restaurant is pretty child friendly. You can park your strollers out front, they have highchairs for toddlers, changing area in the restrooms, and crayons and coloring sheets for the little ones. That alone distracted my toddler long enough to enjoy our meal. \\n\\nWhile I'm probably unlikely to come back again unless I'm showing out of town visitors around SF, I would recommend others to come here if they're looking for somewhere decent to eat around Pier 39.

What can I say, the service was amazing and we were seated almost immediately upon arriving.\\n\\nWe had a gorgeous view of the bay and we could see the sun setting. It was beautiful to see considering it had been raining for the past 2-3 days that we were there visiting. \\n\\nAnyways, we started off with crab cakes for appetizers and my god! They were delicious! Nice and crispy and warm on the inside full of flavor. We were also served their complementary sourdough bread with butter which was great too. For our main course I got the full Dungeness Crab with garlic butter and roasted potatoes and a side of sautéed veggies. My girlfriend got two lobster tails with a side of mashed potatoes and sautéed veggies. The food was amazing, the crab and lobsters were full of meat and flavor! It's safe to say we got messy but it was definitely worth it.\\n\\nOur dishes exceeded our expectations. San Francisco is well known for their seafood and their Dungeness crabs that it was almost a must that we had to eat crab and lobster. With so many places to choose from on Fishermans Wharf  It can be overwhelming as to who serves the best crabs in town. Well, look no further after doing a little research we stumbled across Fog Harbor as our restaurant of choice and it was the best decision we could have made. The food and the staff was excellent. We will definitely be coming back here again in the near future.\\n\",\n",

The Dungeness crab on our first visit was really good and well worth the price. However, on our second visit, when we got two shellfish platters to share between us, we actually found it to be a bit too oily, so maybe these dishes are best enjoyed in moderation...\\n\\nThey also offer 1 hour validation for the parking lot across the street, although for our second visit, service was slow so we couldn't finish in an hour.

Probably didn't need the reservation as it wasn't too pack but we sat at a window table for two that was intimate and romantic so I'd like to think we got that table because we made the reservation. \\nThe food was delicious. We shared a calamari appetizer and the famous clam chowder. The lemon aioli was dense an we felt overpowered the calamari. Luckily we got it in the side but I like I would have prefer a tomato-based dip instead of the aioli. The clam chowder is a must. Very good with so much flavor. We did not get the bread bowl and are glad we didn't. It looked like too much when we saw it on other tables. Could totally get this as a meal or if you have multiple people to share it with but too heavy for a starter for one person. \\nI got one of the specials at the recommendation of the waiter. It was spaghetti in a lemon butter sauce with about 6 different proteins (shrimp, crab, scallops, clams etc). It did not disappoint. We came to eat seafood and I ate seafood. The shrimp was the best part of the dish. Cooked perfectly with so much flavor. He got the Mixed grill. He said it was good but said mine was more flavorful and desirable (because we always share each other's food so we can taste more things). I agreed. The mixed grill wasn't bad but after taking a bite of the seafood mix I had, there wasn't going back.

Great views, nicer decor and service (i.e., not a fast food joint), and serves seafood. Crab roll was average and the clam chowder was a disappointment. \\n\\nFog Harbor is everything you\\'re looking for in a touristy trap restaurant. I\\'ve been told most locals tend to avoid Pier 39, and I was here with my partner who had never been to SF before, so we did the touristy things anyway. Going to Pier 39, I wanted to take her someplace that had seafood (we\\'re literally on the ocean after all), someplace that wasn\\'t a fastfood-y type of establishment (see flash fried everything), and something with good views if possible. All of this was found perfectly inside Fog Harbor. What you won\\'t find here though is mind-blowingly good food, however. We ordered the crab ceviche, \"Award winning\" clam chowder, and a crab roll. \\n\\nI don\\'t particularly like crab ceviche in general, so I won\\'t review it. But the \"Award winning\" clam chowder was a huge let down. As we were waiting in the front of the establishment for a table to open up, they proudly displayed their award for \"Best clam chowder\" in fisherman\\'s warf. Makes me wonder what the competition was like. But it was a bit thicker and more flour-y than I typically like, and really lacked any real flavor beyond general salt and pepper. Wished it was more creamy with a more pronounced clam flavor. The crab roll was served a giant grilled roll which was soft and buttery. The crab filling was rather generic with VERY shredded crab that was mixed in with seemed like mayo (menu said it was an aioli) and some celery. Served cold, it did go well with their fries which were solidly above average.\\n\\nInside the restaurant, the decor was very upscale casual, in that it was very upscale without making me feel I was underdressed in my khaki shorts and t-shirt. More impressively, most of the outward facing walls were primarily windows, and seats not up against the windows were elevated, so that every seat in the place could get a decently good view of the bay. All in all, the location itself provided everything a tourist may look for when prioritizing the experience over the food, and it does it well, hence the 4 * rating.\\n',\n",

I would have liked something else to go with my meal but was never asked how my dinner was or if I needed anything. Very disappointed .\\n',\n",

The portions are generous but it doesn't taste great. The breading on the fish and chips were so thick that on some areas, it was more breading than fish.

This is where the problem started (mainly, with the hostessES - yes, there were more than one - no one was blatantly rude, but I didn\\'t feel like there was any welcome and they weren\\'t friendly):\\n\\n1) I stood there and waited for about a minute before I was acknowledged (there wasn\\'t really anyone in front of me - the hostesses were just busy talking among themselves).\\n2) We sat and waited while everyone that came after was seated (well, maybe they had earlier reservations?).\\n3) By minute 40-ish, I got up to politely ask how much longer is our wait expected to be.  The hostesses asked for my name, fumbled for a bit, and told me \"it will just be a few more minutes\" - no sorry for the wait or anything, and her attitude was that of \"stop being impatient we\\'ll get to you.\"  Well sorry to interrupt your chat amongst each other?\\n4) As SOON as I sat down again in the waiting area, I was told my table was ready by another girl (not the two hostesses - this one was friendlier).  Okay, so a table freed up in the 30 seconds between when I inquired and I sat down, or was I actually forgotten about?\\n\\nTotal time from my time of reservation to when we were seated is about 45 minutes.  If that was the only problem, it would have been okay because sometimes I do understand that things happen - but with everything that happened leading up to that, I am certainly NOT impressed.\\n\\nThe good stuff: the food was decent and I liked our server (whose name I don\\'t remember, but she was attentive, funny, and helpful - and the all the wait staff inside the restaurant were friendly).\\n\\nHonestly though, if they didn\\'t come seat us before the hour was up, I would have gotten up and left.\\n',\n",

At first I thought about getting the Lazy Cioppino (no shells), but part of the fun of seafood is eating with your hands! The scallops were HUGE! Do you see the chunk of white on the right of my picture?? That was one of the scallops!! The crabs were already cracked so it was easy to get the meat out. They provide the cracker and a tiny fork but I didn\\'t need it at all. The fish they used was SALMON, my favorite! The tomato soup was DELICIOUS with chunks of tomato in it. $34 for all that? I\\'d say it was definitely worth it.\\n\\nI also tried some of my coworker\\'s Lobster Tail, which I was also contemplating but my Cioppino was DEFINITELY the winner. The Lobster Tail was way smaller than I expected, and kinda dry. The melted butter didn\\'t help very much with flavor.\\n\\nWe wrapped it up with dessert. I thought the way they present dessert was VERY smart. They have all their desserts brought to you on a tray, then they introduce each one. I asked our waiter what he recommends personally and we ended up with two: House-made Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee and Strawberry Shortcake. The brulee was good, but the shortcake was better IMO. Super soft shortcake with whipped cream and fruits drowning in syrup. Not SUPER sweet either.\\n\\nThe only thing I regret now is my coworkers knowing how much I eat...\\n',\n",
              " 'They have the best Clam Chowder that i\\'ve ever had, hands down. Like, I\\'d go here just for the clam chowder.\\nI\\'ve been here twice.. First visit, We sat in the main room, lights are pretty dim, low restaurant music playing.. really nice but not too fancy restaurant. Cute date spot for sure! Our server was great, he actually took the time to talk to us, ask what we like and made some suggestions. I ordered the shellfish platter for one. I enjoy it. Could have used a little more flavor but that\\'s probably just me lol.. next time, i\\'ll just ask to add garlic butter over the top.\\n\\nThe second time I sat towards the back of the restaurant, \"upstairs\". I ordered the Garlic Roasted Whole Dungeness Crab (ask for extra garlic butter, if you like a lot like me), which came with veggies and small roasted potatoes. That was definitely a plus because at any other restaurant i\\'ve been to an ordered a whole crab, it just comes with the crab.. nothing more! The price for that was $45.. about the same as most places on the pier but felt more of a win because it came with sides.\\n\\nFog Harbor has to be my favorite restaurant on the pier, so far. From the restaurant set up & feel, to the servers, food, & scenery. I highly recommend giving it a try.\\n',\n",

I must say, I was not disappointed. \\nWhile expensive, it is worth it. The ahi poke with wasabi aioli is the perfect mix of sweet, salty and fishy, balanced well with the hearty slices of avocado. Our waiter said this was his favorite dish too. The surf and turf is a great dish to split if you're not too hungry.  We got our steak medium-well (my date's preference) and the meat was very evenly cooked and still very juicy. The lobster tail was buttery and had just the right amount of firmness to the texture. The drinks were average, with my date's lipstick lemon drop being sweet enough to mask the alcohol, and my Moscow Mule being a little watery. We asked for the Mule to be sent back, and the waiter was happy to oblige. \\nI must say, I had a hell of a time trying to find parking in this area, so I definitely don't recommend that mode of transportation to get to this restaurant.

While the variety on their menu is appealing, I always end up going w/my old favorites, a dozen raw oysters and the seafood platter.  If you like garlic and fresh seafood, the seafood platter is the way to go--dungeness crab, shrimp, mussels, clams, and potatoes steamed well and lightly swimming in a butter/garlic sauce--and the sauce is surprisingly light and doesn't congeal and make you feel gross about yourself once you finish the plate.  I've also had the caesar, which is executed well--simple and with homemade dressing.  The wine list is brief but well-chosen.  And the best part?  You can get on the waitlist w/Yelp!\\n\",\n",

Since he's the planner in this family, I gave him the task of finding a  restaurant that had strong reviews. We wanted something that was unique to San Francisco with a heavy emphasis on seafood selections. We don't eat mammals and our diet that is pretty much that of a pescatarian/vegetarian. \\n\\nWhat baffled us was that we booked our reservation via OpenTable a couple of months in advance. What we noticed was that their reservations were booked ahead of time and that we needed to secure a spot right away. So we set it up for the two of us a couple of months before we even arrived.\\n\\nFog Harbor is located at Pier 39, right off of The Embarcadero. It's on the second level of the shopping district, at the top of the stairs. This is an ideal location because it's right at the entrance to Pier 39 so you can't miss it. There are other restaurant chains there but when you travel, you want something different from what you already have back home.\\n\\nAnyway, I didn't know that my husband's coworker would be joining us for dinner. So I called Fog Harbor and asked if it would be ok if I added one more person to the reservation. They said that it was alright. However, I wasn't aware that his coworker was also bringing his mother and brother who were visiting from New Jersey. Now we were faced with a situation!!!  The initial reservation went from 2 to 3 people and was now at a total of 5 people. So I explained the situation to the hostess and she gave me that look that a teacher gives their students. It wasn't good BUT she gave us the option of waiting for a table to open up OR be seated at one of the elevated tables away from the window. We were hungry so we went for the second option. As it turned out, we still had a nice view of the water as well as The Golden Gate Bridge.\\n\\nThe menu has a heavy seafood emphasis which was right up our alley. I was tempted to try to swordfish fish but I was more intrigued with the Pacific Sole. It was served on a bed of spinach and fingerling potatoes. This was one of those cases in which the food tasted as good as it looked. The sole was delicious and melted in my mouth. The texture and flavor were ON POINT!!!! Everyone else at the table had high regards for their food as well. \\n\\nMy husband's coworker stated that he's never had swordfish before. With this being his first serving of swordfish, he said it was amazing. He's now hooked on it and won't pass it up when it appears on any other menus in the future.\\n\\nI really appreciate how flexible the staff were at Fog Harbor. I was nervous about showing up with 3 extra people, given that we had to make this reservation so far in advance. Our entire experience was pleasant and I can see why this place is popular with locals and tourists.

I think he noticed my guests didn\\'t speak English so in addition to the text-only-menu, he brought over a special menu with pictures - my Chinese friends were so grateful. Being chinese, we ordered hot water with our food. Not only did he NOT judge us by our choice of drink (this happened at Market Steer Steakhouse in Santa Fe, NM), this waiter went above and beyond by regularly filling our cups and tea pot with hot water. He even noticed that leaving the tea pot lid open meant we need a refill. He explained how to use the bibs + waste bowls for our shellfish and even helped my friend put it on. However, at the end of the meal, my friends fought for the bill but didn\\'t understand how to tip despite truly appreciating the service.

And in a square plate with the dressing on the side with no room to move anything without it falling off the sides of the dish. It was just not physically possible to eat this salad with grace.  The mussel fries were super salty. I tried dipping fries in the sauce a few times and I just couldn't more than three or so. Baked oysters were also salty. Eh. I get it.

However, we sat for a good 10-15 minutes ignored by at least 3-4 staff members, including who we would find out to be our actual waitress.

Ooookay? However, her attitude adjusted quickly when she came back, and was extremely accommodating and polite afterwards.\\n\\nAs for the food, like I said, it was heavy. We order the mussel fries to start, which were quite tasty. The broth was rich, but good when you dipped it in the sourdough. I wish the fries were served on the side or something, as well as the aioli put on the side rather than drizzled on top. We couldn't squeeze the lemon on the mussels before finishing the fries first. But everything was cooked well.\\n\\nFor my entree, I got the clam chowder and Caesar salad combo, but could barely finish half of the clam chowder. My family enjoyed the cioppino, ahi tuna, and seafood penne. I picked off their plates, and the seafood penne would be my favorite! The tomato cream sauce was hearty but not overwhelming and the dish had a lot of seafood in it. The cioppino was slightly too salty for me, but anything goes with that delicious sourdough you get for free! The sourdough isn't too sour, but has a more subtle flavor than most sourdough breads I've had in SF. Pretty good! When in doubt, DIP THE SOURDOUGH IN YOUR FOOD.\\n\",\n",

Pier 39/Fisherman's Wharf is one of those exceptions, a place I have loved since I first visited in 1975/6. During a recent trip to San Francisco/Monterey, we visited Fog Harbor twice. Once at the beginning of the trip. Once at the end.\\n\\nOur first visit came at the end of a long day of travel. We scored the last booth in the place, ordered a crisp white or four and a mess of sppetizers. Calamari, a spicy shrimp app. Everything was outstanding and delivered with a smile. We really enjoyed ourselves and the trip got off to a very nice start.\\n\\nOur second visit was on the fourth of July. Pandemonium was the name of the game. Out on the Wharf and inside the restaurant. We waited forty five minutes due to an odd snafu with Open Table that isn't worth getting into. Our table was very nice with an outstanding view of the water and passing squadrons of Brown Pelican. We ordered more nice white wine, apps, crab salad and fried shrimp. Again, everything was delicious.\\n\\nMidway through our meal, a family with two small children were seated next to us. While one parent played on his phone, and the other strolled around the restaurant looking to charge up her phone, the two kids screamed, blocked passers by, nearly tripped servers. One kid ran around clutching a butter knife. The little pisher then wacked my wife in the back of the head. In a perfect world, these people and their obnoxious children would have been hustled to the door and told never to return. But I'm quite sure the Cornell School for Hospitality frowns on that.\\n\\nA hard working manager tried to stop the insanity.

I went all out and ordered a bunch of dishes including oysters, crab cake, whole Dungeness crab, clam chowder, etc. for a couple of hundred dollars. Food was very fresh and tasty. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. And the view was amazing. \\n\\nMy dad was super happy with the food and whole experience. I was so glad he liked it. This place deff brings back memories.

We decided to come to Pier39 for lunch because it had some good reviews on Yelp and you could see the water from the restaurant. As soon as we walked into the restaurant we were greeted and seated in the back of the restaurant with views of the water.  It was great that they automatically filled up all of the tables near the water first rather than having to ask like at some restaurants.  \\n\\nOur waiter finished up with another table then a few minutes later, greeted us and took our drink order.  He brought our drinks then came back to take our lunch order.  I ordered the clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl, my nephew got a cup of soup and my sister got a salad.  A few minutes later the waiter brought us some bread and butter which was very good! You could easily tell it was made fresh.\\n\\nThe waiter noticed my water was gone and said he would bring some more.  A little bit later our meal came and it looked great.  Our waiter welcomed some other tables, brought them some water and I think then remembered about my water so he came back about 10 minutes later with some water.  I was so thirsty.\\n  \\nThe meal was very good and the prices weren't bad especially since we were in such a high tourist part of town.  Our waiter seemed like he took a while to bring the check but did get it and offered to validate parking but we already had it validated from somewhere else. \\nOverall lunch was nice.

We had a few things to try and it was all pretty good. We had the award winning clam chowder, Dungeness crab cakes, raw oysters, jumbo scallop and crab risotto, and the ahi tuna. The clam chowder was definitely great, it was not too heavy but just enough, it had a great portion of bacon and all the good stuff. The crab cakes were good as well. I liked the scallop and crab risotto as well. But the service here, was just terrible. Our drinks were never refilled or asked if we wanted another drink. We had to ask for everything, straws, etc . Our table was never cleared at anytime either. All of our plates were just sitting on the table. I was stacking plates one on top of another to open up space. Even after we moved on from the apps to the dinner items everything was left behind, app plates, the empty app plates, the oysters, everything. The oyster dish was sitting on our table even when we left which we finished fairly quickly after they were dropped off at our table. The ice turned into water and the oyster shells were floating around in the dish. \\n\\nAfter paying $170+ dollars is this what I should expect? By all means I have no issue spending money on food. But it really just hits a nerve when I get crappy service and I'm paying for it.....\\n\\nI would go else where if your thinking about The Fog Harbor Fish House.\\n\",\n",

That was the baked oysters, the famous clam chowder in a bread bowl, and whole dungeness crab. \\n\\nThe baked oysters was such an awesome starter. That oyster was so freshly cooked and flavor was absolutely stunningly delicious. I wish I had 3 dozens of those. \\n\\nThe famous clam chowder in a bread bowl. Probably the best clam chowder I have ever had. The consistency, the flavor, and the chuck of clams were great. The sour dough bread really compliments well with the clam chowder. \\n\\nThe whole dungeness crab, I was looking really forward too. When our server came out with the crab I was shocked it was split into 2 plates. I had assume it was presented as a whole crab, but instead our server requested the kitchen staff to split into 2 plates without asking me. The presentation lost its \"WOW\" factor and I was super disappointed in that. \\n\\nOtherwise the crab was very good. Great garlic flavor. Good chunks of crab meat. \\n\\nShould really give this place a shot. Great seafood dishes. Except if you get a whole crab, make sure they serve it whole and not split between two plates.\\n',\n",

Like shrimp cocktail, but with extremely fresh lump crab meat. It's straightforward but the seafood is quality, it's worth getting.\\n\\nThe chowder in a sourdough bread bowl was really bland. We seasoning it ourselves at the table but it still didn't hit the mark. I got the Cioppino, crab, fish, shrimp, clams, scallops and mussels in tomato broth.The broth was also under seasoned, for the most part the seafood was good though (especially the crab, seems to be a strong choice here), just not a dish that was worth $34. The fried combo (shrimp, calamari, fish with cole slaw and fries) was totally over fried. \\n\\nOverall it's a nice view, overpriced, but the raw seafood is worth getting if you find yourself here.\\n\",\n",

These were enough to fill us up cuz the portions were pretty generous. In short, I liked everything we ordered but I think everything was over-seasoned here.

The server was making cheap racists comments about how we needed a picture book of menu to select from?! Do you think we are uneducated? We have masters from ivy leagues so please don't jump into conclusions. Next, he had a huge problem with us sharing the food. Since it was 3pm already, we weren't too hungry so we ordered 4 dishes in total and shared. Is that a sin? He was continuously making comments to his fellow waiters serving us about how we are sharing our food. To end it, he was very interested to see how much we tipped him?!

Its location on Pier 39 might initially be a turn-off if you are really just trying to scratch a seafood itch and don\\'t relish the idea of wading through all the tourists milling around the shops. However, the food is worth it. Luckily enough, the restaurant is located on the second floor of one of the buildings closest to curbside, so not much wading is involved. \\n\\nI would describe the interior of the restaurant as \"modern\". The seating options are a mix of booths and standard tables, as well as space at the bar, which I think was for walk-ins. Large windows facing the moorings for the Blue & Gold tour boats lets lots of light in during the day and makes for a nice view from the window tables.\\n\\nThe menu is definitely geared towards seafood aficionados, though there are some non-seafood choices. As I understand it, Fog Harbor is part of the Simmons Family Restaurants group, which has several types of seafood restaurants in and around Pier 39. One thing to bear in mind is that this is the more \"proper\" of the group\\'s restaurants, and is pricier as a result. \\n\\nYou will be hard pressed to find better seafood for the price though. On both of our visits here, we ordered the cioppino (seafood stew), the clam chowder, and the bay scallops. The seafood is all fresh, tasty, and generously portioned. The main courses I ordered were the lobster tails on our first visit, and the scallop and crab risotto the second visit. Both dishes were phenomenal.\\n\\nOne thing worth mentioning is that the servers we got both times were very attentive and friendly. Our second visit was actually for a birthday lunch, which I made a note of on my reservation, and our server (Kayla) gave us a dessert on the house, complete with a candle in it! It was the tiramisu, which is definitely worth saving space for. \\n\\nIn short, I am already looking forward to my next visit to Fog Harbor!\\n',\n",

Mouth.Watering. it's the jalapenos, i swear! And to top it off with the lemon aioli. I died, inside. Happily.\\n\\nThe shellfish platter is a must! The hubs is a big guy, so the platter for two plus the lobster was filling for him. I feel as though if he were to have bought it for 1, he'd be asking for a snickers bar (drumroll, with a hit of the symbols - bam). Shellfish platter for two came with 1 whole crab, 12 clams, 12 shrimp and 12 mussels. We added a lobster for an additional cost.\\n\\n The seafood penne was satisfying. Not as much flavor as I wished for, but I guess it's expected when you have a variety of seafood in a pasta - I'm assuming they were trying to put an emphasis in the seafood, rather than seasoning it up and hiding the seafood's natural flavor. And I am not mad at that.\\n\\nAnd to end our beautiful experience (almost cried because desserts are always a reminder that you are almost done) I couldn't help, but salivate over their apple crisp. Lord, help me.\\n\\nJust screw this review and go and get yourself a seat at this place.\\n\",\n",

Mind you, we were aware this being a seafood joint, but our plan was to order her a pasta dish and omit the meat. Usually this is just fine. So she ordered the chicken and vegetable penne without chicken. What she got was watery pasta, with mostly raw green beans, red onions, zucchini. No sauce, no cheese, absolutely no flavor. What self respecting cook didn't even think to caramelize those veggies for some flavor, add garlic, or serve it with some type of sauce. Sent that disaster back and they did take it off our bill. \\n\\nI had the cioppino- it was ok but the sauce tasted overwhelmingly like dry herbs- think prego pasta sauce. \\n\\nThird friend got the fish n chips.

There are a mixture of people from different places, but they all are smiling and happy. \\n\\nThe food:\\nSince this was my first time here, I can't talk about the food fully, BUT I'll say that what we had was great. We started with the calamari, which was fresh and lightly fried (perfection). The mixed grill and salmon plates were also impeccable and I'd definitely recommend.

Not being a huge ravioli guy (but wanting some sort of non-bread carb with my meal) I didn't expect to be as blown away as I was. The ravioli was cooked thoroughly and the ricotta inside was smooth. The pasta itself paired well with the spinach and the Dungeness crab. Every bite was seriously perfection.\\n\\nAtmosphere: The restaurant is fancy and more upscale. The waiters are all professionally uniformed. Lots of tables looked like dates or nice dinner nights out. \\n\\nParking: Given that this place is literally on the pier, parking will be a hassle to drive to this place.

The drink itself was extremely sour, and I can't believe it had egg whites in it bc it typically cuts any sour flavor.  No one ever checked to see how the drinks were, so I finished it begrudgingly. Not the best $15 I've ever spent. The oysters were phenomenal as was the sourdough bread. If I would have been able to order a different drink, it would have been 5 stars.\\n\",\n",

Now, the food and the food.  :)  Bread rolls are freshly baked sourdough, a San Francisco classic, just ask for extra butter.  Another SF classic is the cioppino, which a mixture of seafood in a mildly spicy tomato broth.  Got it lazy style, which is less messy as the crab is taken out of the shell.  All the hard work is done, all you have to do is enjoy every bite.  My fiancee got the sliders for lunch because she doesn't like seafood, they were really good.
